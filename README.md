Improving the Educational Web System. 
I am Planning to improve the functionality of allowing downloading slide in bulk. Specifically, I am thinking to implement a buffer loading for previous and next slides so user experiences are better. Currently the system only allow one slide loading at a time and will only load the next or previous slide if user makes a click.
