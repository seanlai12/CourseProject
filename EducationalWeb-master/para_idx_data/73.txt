So the problem is the following. We have a query that has a sequence of words, and a document that's also a sequence of words, and we hope to define the function f ( . , . ) that can compute a score based on the query and document. The main challenge is designing a good ranking function that can rank all the relevant documents on top of all the non-relevant ones. Now clearly this means our function must be able to measure the likelihood that a document d is relevant to a query q. That also means we have to have some way to define relevance. In particular, in order to implement the program to do that, we have to have a computational definition of relevance, and we achieve this goal by designing a retrieval model which gives us a formalization of relevance. We introduce retrieval models in the Chapter 6.
