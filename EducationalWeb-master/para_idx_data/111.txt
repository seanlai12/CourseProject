A brief review of many different kinds of retrieval models can be found in Chapter 2 Zhai [2008]. The vector space model with pivoted length normalization was proposed and discussed in detail in Singhal et al. [1996]. The query likelihood retrieval model was initially proposed in Ponte and Croft [1998]. A useful reference for the BM25 retrieval function is Robertson and Zaragoza [2009]. A comprehensive survey of language models for information retrieval can be found in Zhai [2008]. A formal treatment of retrieval heuristics is given in Fang et al. [2004], and a diagnostic evaluation method for assessing deficiencies of a retrieval model is proposed in Fang et al. [2011], where multiple improved basic retrieval functions are also derived.
