The security of our computer systems and data is at continual risk. The extensive growth of the Internet and the increasing availability of tools and tricks for intruding and attacking networks have prompted intrusion detection and prevention to become a critical component of networked systems. An intrusion can be defined as any set of actions that threaten the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of a network resource (e.g., user accounts, file systems, system kernels, and so on). Intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems both monitor network traffic and/or system executions for malicious activities. However, the former produces reports whereas the latter is placed in-line and is able to actively prevent/block intrusions that are detected. The main functions of an intrusion prevention system are to identify malicious activity, log information about said activity, attempt to block/stop activity, and report activity. The majority of intrusion detection and prevention systems use either signaturebased detection or anomaly-based detection. Signature-based detection: This method of detection utilizes signatures, which are attack patterns that are preconfigured and predetermined by domain experts. A signature-based intrusion prevention system monitors the network traffic for matches to these signatures. Once a match is found, the intrusion detection system will report the anomaly and an intrusion prevention system will take additional appropriate actions. Note that since the systems are usually quite dynamic, the signatures need to be updated laboriously whenever new software versions arrive or changes in network configuration or other situations occur. Another drawback is that such a detection mechanism can only identify cases that match the signatures. That is, it is unable to detect new or previously unknown intrusion tricks.
