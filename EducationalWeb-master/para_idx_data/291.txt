Information retrieval-based techniques use the notion of sentence vectors and similarity functions in order to create a summarization text. A sentence vector is equivalent in structure to a document vector, albeit based on a smaller number of words. Below, we will outline a basic information retrieval-based summarization system. 1. Split the document to be summarized into sections or passages. 2. For each passage, "compress" its sentences into a smaller number of relevant (yet not redundant) sentences. This strategy retains coherency since the sentences in the summary are mostly in the same order as they were in the original document. Step one is portrayed in Figure 16.1. The sentences in the document are traversed in order and a normalized, symmetric similarity measure (see Chapter 14) is applied on adjacent pairs of sentences. The plot on the right-hand side of the figure shows the change in similarity between the sentences. We can inspect these changes to segment the document into passages when the similarity is low, i.e., a shift in topic occurs. An alternative approach to this segmentation is to simply use paragraphs if the document being operated on contains that information, although most of the time this is not the case. This rudimentary partitioning strategy is a task in vector 1 vector 2 vector 3 … … similarity similarity vector n -1 vector n discourse analysis (a subfield of NLP). Discourse analysis deals with sequences of sentences as opposed to only one sentence. Now that we have our passages, how can we remove redundancy and increase diversity in the resulting summarization during step two? The technique maximal marginal relevance (MMR) reranking can be applied to our problem. Essentially, this algorithm greedily reranks each sentence in the current passage, outputting only the top few as a summary. Figure 16.2 shows the output of the algorithm when we only select one sentence from each passage.
