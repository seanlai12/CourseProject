Although DBSCAN can cluster objects given input parameters such as (the maximum radius of a neighborhood) and MinPts (the minimum number of points required in the neighborhood of a core object), it encumbers users with the responsibility of selecting parameter values that will lead to the discovery of acceptable clusters. This is a problem associated with many other clustering algorithms. Such parameter settings Algorithm: DBSCAN: a density-based clustering algorithm.
