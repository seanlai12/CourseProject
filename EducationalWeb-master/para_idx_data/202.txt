Given n users and m objects, determine the running time of recommending one item to each user using collaborative filtering. Keep in mind the running time of a particular similarity algorithm-first, assume we are using cosine similarity. Would using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient instead change the running time? 11.9. As a method to improve the running time of collaborative filtering, we can consider only the top-k most active users, where k n. An active user is one that has given a large amount of ratings. What is a potential problem with this method? 11.10. Imagine we run a collaborative filtering system on a database of movies. One movie producer creates many accounts on the collaborative filtering system and only gives high ratings to movies produced by their own company and low ratings to all others. Is the collaborative filtering system described in this chapter susceptible to such spam? If so, brainstorm some anti-spamming measures. 11.11. A collaborative filtering system treats each item independently, even if they are almost identical. For example, movies in a trilogy would be treated separately. Give an example where this is desired and give an example where this is problemental.
