What steps need to be taken when new elements are added to the collaborative filtering dataset (e.g., new books are released)? Do we have the same cold start problem as before? 11.13. Is there some relation of RMSE and MAE to L 1 and L 2 error? Recall that L 1 error is defined as and L 2 error is defined as where y i represents the true value of a prediction, f (x i ) is the prediction itself, and n is the total number of predictions.
