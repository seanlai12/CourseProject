META's modularity supports exploration, encourages contributions, and increases visibility to its inner workings. These facts make it a perfect companion toolkit for this book. As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, readers will follow exercises that add real functionality to the toolkit. After reading this book and learning about text data management and analysis, it is envisioned readers continue to modify META to suit their text information needs, building upon their newfound knowledge. Finally, since META will always be free and open-source, readers as a community can jointly contribute to its functionality, benefiting all those involved.
