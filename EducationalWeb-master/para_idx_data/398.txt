A simple version of sentiment analysis is called word valence scoring. A finite list of words has a positive or negative valence score. When determining the sentiment for a sentence, the valence scores are added up for each word in the sentence; if the result is positive, the sentiment is positive. If the result is negative, the sentiment is negative. For example, some valences could be bad = âˆ’4.5, awesome = 6.3, acceptable = 1.1. What is a potential weakness to this method? 18.4. How can we automatically create the sentiment word valence scores based on a list of sentences labeled as positive or negative? 18.5. The techniques discussed in this chapter can be applied to other problems aside from sentiment analysis in particular. Name some applications that also would benefit from the general methods discussed in this chapter. Explain how you would implement them.
