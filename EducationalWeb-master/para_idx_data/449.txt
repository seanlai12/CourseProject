Sections 2.4.2 through 2.4.5 discussed how to compute the dissimilarity between objects described by attributes of the same type, where these types may be either nominal, symmetric binary, asymmetric binary, numeric, or ordinal. However, in many real databases, objects are described by a mixture of attribute types. In general, a database can contain all of these attribute types. "So, how can we compute the dissimilarity between objects of mixed attribute types?" One approach is to group each type of attribute together, performing separate data mining (e.g., clustering) analysis for each type. This is feasible if these analyses derive compatible results. However, in real applications, it is unlikely that a separate analysis per attribute type will generate compatible results. A more preferable approach is to process all attribute types together, performing a single analysis. One such technique combines the different attributes into a single dissimilarity matrix, bringing all of the meaningful attributes onto a common scale of the interval [0.0, 1.0]. Suppose that the data set contains p attributes of mixed type. The dissimilarity d(i, j) between objects i and j is defined as , there is no measurement of attribute f for object i or object j), or (2) x if = x jf = 0 and attribute f is asymmetric binary; otherwise, Î´ (f ) ij = 1. The contribution of attribute f to the dissimilarity between i and j (i.e., d where h runs over all nonmissing objects for attribute f .
