Recall that, in k-means, an object is assigned to the closest center. What if a nearest-center assignment violates a cannot-link constraint? To respect cannot-link constraints, we modify the center assignment process in k-means to a nearest feasible center assignment. That is, when the objects are assigned to centers in sequence, at each step we make sure the assignments so far do not violate any cannot-link constraints. An object is assigned to the nearest center so that the assignment respects all cannot-link constraints. Because COP-k-means ensures that no constraints are violated at every step, it does not require any backtracking. It is a greedy algorithm for generating a clustering that satisfies all constraints, provided that no conflicts exist among the constraints.
