Starting with the Bernoulli distribution for a single coin flip, we expanded it into a set of trials with the binomial distribution. We investigated parameter estimation via MLE, and then moved onto a Bayesian approach. We compared the Bayesian result to smoothing with pseudo counts and saw how hyperparameters affected the distribution. Once we had this foundation, we moved onto multidimensional distributions capable of representing individual words. We saw how the Beta-binomial model is related to the Dirichlet-multinomial model, and inspected it in the context of Dirichlet prior smoothing for query likelihood in IR.
