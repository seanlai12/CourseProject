When the ground truth of a data set is not available, we have to use an intrinsic method to assess the clustering quality. In general, intrinsic methods evaluate a clustering by examining how well the clusters are separated and how compact the clusters are. Many intrinsic methods have the advantage of a similarity metric between objects in the data set. The silhouette coefficient is such a measure. For a data set, D, of n objects, suppose D is partitioned into k clusters, C 1 , . .  (10.32) The silhouette coefficient of o is then defined as The value of the silhouette coefficient is between âˆ’1 and 1. The value of a(o) reflects the compactness of the cluster to which o belongs. The smaller the value, the more compact the cluster. The value of b(o) captures the degree to which o is separated from other clusters. The larger b(o) is, the more separated o is from other clusters. Therefore, when the silhouette coefficient value of o approaches 1, the cluster containing o is compact and o is far away from other clusters, which is the preferable case. However, when the silhouette coefficient value is negative (i.e., b(o) < a(o)), this means that, in expectation, o is closer to the objects in another cluster than to the objects in the same cluster as o. In many cases, this is a bad situation and should be avoided. To measure a cluster's fitness within a clustering, we can compute the average silhouette coefficient value of all objects in the cluster. To measure the quality of a clustering, we can use the average silhouette coefficient value of all objects in the data set. The silhouette coefficient and other intrinsic measures can also be used in the elbow method to heuristically derive the number of clusters in a data set by replacing the sum of within-cluster variances.
