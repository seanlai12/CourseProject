The MMR algorithm is as follows. Assume we are given an original list R and a profile p to construct the set of selected sentences S (where |S| |R|). R is a partitioned chunk of sentences in the document we wish to summarize. The profile p determines what is exactly meant by "relevance." Originally, the MMR formula was applied to documents returned from an information retrieval system (hence the term reranking). Documents were selected based on their marginal relevance to a query (which is our variable p) in addition to non-redundancy to already-selected documents. Since our task deals with sentence retrieval, p can be a user profile (text about the user), the entire document itself, or it could even be a query formulated by the user. According to marginal relevance, the next sentence s i to be added into the selected list S is defined as
