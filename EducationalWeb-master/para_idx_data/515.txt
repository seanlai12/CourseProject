Give an example of how specific clustering methods can be integrated, for example, where one clustering algorithm is used as a preprocessing step for another. In addition, provide reasoning as to why the integration of two methods may sometimes lead to improved clustering quality and efficiency. 10.14 Clustering is recognized as an important data mining task with broad applications. Give one application example for each of the following cases: (a) An application that uses clustering as a major data mining function. (b) An application that uses clustering as a preprocessing tool for data preparation for other data mining tasks.
