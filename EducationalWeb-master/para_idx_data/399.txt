Chapter 15. How can cross-fold validation be used to detect potential overfitting? 18.7. We mentioned that a main challenge in designing features is to optimize the tradeoff between exhaustivity and specificity. Can you design an experimental training setup that takes these variables into account? 18.8. In LARA, why do you imagine the vector of weights Î± is drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution? That is, why not use some other distribution? 18.9. In LARA, each word is assigned an aspect, but this means that one sentence may be assigned many different aspects. Can you outline an adjustment to ensure that each sentence only covers one topic or a small number of topics? Similarly, can we ensure that sequences of words all belong to the same aspect? 18.10. Instead of a classification task, it may be beneficial to instead rank text objects by how positive they are (so low-ranking documents are very negative). Outline a few methods on how this may be achieved. What are the benefits and downsides compared to classification? 18.11. Imagine that you have an unlabeled dataset of product reviews. How can you design a sentiment classifier based on this dataset without manually labeling all of the documents?
