In general, we can envision a high-level architecture of a unified system for supporting text management and analysis, as shown in Figure 20.7, where multiple levels of services are provided to users, including a preprocessing step of natural language processing, a low-level service for multi-mode text data access, which includes querying, browsing, and recommendation, a medium-level service for text data analysis, which includes general analysis operators that can be combined with each other, and high-level application support, which includes support of application-specific user tasks. It is important that a user has access to all these levels via a unified interaction interface where the user also has access to a working space that is personalized according to a specific user and a specific application task. In this figure, we also show the availability of the non-textual data, which would generally need a database system to manage it and serve some other modules such as text analysis (in this case, non-text data can be used as context for analyzing text data). Finally, we see that we can often further apply general data mining algorithms such as EM and predictive modeling to process the results that our analysts have obtained. As an example, consider a news mining application. If a user performs a keyword search, a large number of documents containing matching text may be returned. If we run a topic analysis on the set of returned articles, we can enable browsing the results to allow the user to more efficiently sift through the data. If the user 20. 3   finds two promising clusters, they can be merged together and searched again with different keywords. This process may be repeated until the user's information need is satisfied.
