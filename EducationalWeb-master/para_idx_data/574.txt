In this section, we outline the major developments and research efforts in mining complex data types. Complex data types are summarized in Figure 13.1. Section 13.1.1 covers mining sequence data such as time-series, symbolic sequences, and biological sequences. Section 13.1.2 discusses mining graphs and social and information networks. Section 13.1.3 addresses mining other kinds of data, including spatial data, spatiotemporal data, moving-object data, cyber-physical system data, multimedia data, text data, c 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Time-series data (e.g., stock market data) Symbolic sequences (e.g., customer shopping sequences, web click streams) Biological sequences (e.g., DNA and protein sequences) Homogeneous (nodes/links are of same type) or heterogeneous (nodes/links are of different types) Examples: Graphs and social, and information networks, etc. Spatial data Spatiotemporal data Cyber-physical system data Multimedia data Text data Web data Data streams Figure 13.1 Complex data types for mining. web data, and data streams. Due to the broad scope of these themes, this section presents only a high-level overview; these topics are not discussed in-depth in this book.
