These characterize sporadic changes due to chance events such as labor disputes or announced personnel changes within companies. Trend analysis can also be used for time-series forecasting, that is, finding a mathematical function that will approximately generate the historic patterns in a time series, and using it to make long-term or short-term predictions of future values. ARIMA (auto-regressive integrated moving average), long-memory time-series modeling, and autoregression are popular methods for such analysis.
