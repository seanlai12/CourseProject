The most important tool for supporting text data access is a search engine, which is why web search engines are used by many people on a daily basis. Search engines directly provide support for querying and can be easily extended to provide recommendation or browsing. Moreover, the techniques used to implement an effective search engine are often also useful for implementation of a recommender system as well as many text analysis functions. We thus devote a large portion of this book to discussing search engine techniques. In this section, we discuss the problem of text retrieval (TR), which is solved by developing a search engine system. We specify the differences between unstructured TR and structured database retrieval. We then make an argument for document ranking as opposed to document selection. This provides a basis for us to discuss in the next chapter how to rank documents for a query. From a user's perspective, the problem of TR is to use a query to find relevant documents in a collection of text documents. This is a frequently needed task because users often have temporary ad hoc information needs for various tasks,
