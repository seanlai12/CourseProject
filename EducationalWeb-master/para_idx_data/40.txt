A statistical language model (or just language model for short) is a probability distribution over word sequences. It thus gives any sequence of words a potentially different probability. For example, a language model may give the following threeword sequences different probabilities: Clearly, a language model can be context-dependent. In the language model shown above, the sequence The equation has a solution has a smaller probability than Today is Wednesday. This may be a reasonable language model for describ-
