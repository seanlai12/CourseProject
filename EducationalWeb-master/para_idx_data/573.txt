As a young research field, data mining has made significant progress and covered a broad spectrum of applications since the 1980s. Today, data mining is used in a vast array of areas. Numerous commercial data mining systems and services are available. Many challenges, however, still remain. In this final chapter, we introduce the mining of complex data types as a prelude to further in-depth study readers may choose to do. In addition, we focus on trends and research frontiers in data mining. Section 13.1 presents an overview of methodologies for mining complex data types, which extend the concepts and tasks introduced in this book. Such mining includes mining time-series, sequential patterns, and biological sequences; graphs and networks; spatiotemporal data, including geospatial data, moving-object data, and cyber-physical system data; multimedia data; text data; web data; and data streams. Section 13.2 briefly introduces other approaches to data mining, including statistical methods, theoretical foundations, and visual and audio data mining. In Section 13.3, you will learn more about data mining applications in business and in science, including the financial retail, and telecommunication industries, science and engineering, and recommender systems. The social impacts of data mining are discussed in Section 13.4, including ubiquitous and invisible data mining, and privacy-preserving data mining. Finally, in Section 13.5 we speculate on current and expected data mining trends that arise in response to new challenges in the field.
