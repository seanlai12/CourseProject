Information synthesis and analysis plays two important roles. For one, it enables a user to quickly identify the most relevant text data, which is often what we really need for solving a problem, thus avoiding dealing with a huge amount of non-relevant text data. Such a strategy of data selection (reduction) is logically the very first step we should take when tackling the scalability problem caused by the size of data. Secondly, it provides knowledge provenance in the sense that it allows a user to easily navigate into any source to examine its reliability in depth. At this extreme, the computer has done the minimum, if anything at all, to support text analysis. However, the system (i.e., search engine) is very robust and can handle large amounts of data quickly. At the other extreme, the system can attempt to provide task support directly to the user so as to minimize the user's effort, as illustrated in Figure 20.2.
