Perhaps the most common text-processing technique is frequency counting. This simply counts how many times each unique word appears in a document (or corpus). Viewing a descending list of words sorted by frequency can give you an idea of what the document is about. Intuitively, similar documents should have some of the same high-frequency words . . . not including stop words. Instead of single words, we can also look at strings of n words, called n-grams. Consider this sentence: I took a vacation to go to a beach.
