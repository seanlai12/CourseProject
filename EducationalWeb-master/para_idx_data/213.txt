How similar are context ("cat") and context ("dog")? How similar are context ("cat") and context ("computer")?  in the left part of this context. That is, what words occur before we see cat or dog? Clearly, these two words have a similar left context. In the same sense, if you look at the words that occur after cat and dog (the right context), we see that they are also very similar in this case. In general, we'll see many other words that can follow both cat and dog. We can even look at the general context; this includes all the words in the sentence or in sentences around this word. Even in the general context, there is also similarity between the two words. Examining context is a general way of discovering paradigmatic words. Let's consider the following questions. How similar is the context of cat and dog? In contrast, how similar are the contexts of cat and computer? Intuitively, the context of cat and the context of dog would be more similar than the context of cat and computer. That means in the first case the similarity value would be high, and in the second, the similarity would be low. This is the basic idea of what paradigmatic relations capture. For syntagmatic relations, we're going to explore correlated occurrences, again based on the definition of syntagmatic relations. Figure 13.2 shows the same sample of text as the example before. Here, however, we're interested in knowing what other words are correlated with the verb eats. On the right side of the figure we've taken away the two words around eats. Then, we ask the question, what words tend to occur to the left of eats? What words tend to occur to the right of eats? Therefore, the question here has to do with whether there are some other words that tend to co-occur with eats. For example, knowing whether eats occurs in a sentence would
