The clustering methods discussed so far are data-driven-they partition the set of objects and adapt to the distribution of the objects in the embedding space. Alternatively, a grid-based clustering method takes a space-driven approach by partitioning the embedding space into cells independent of the distribution of the input objects. The grid-based clustering approach uses a multiresolution grid data structure. It quantizes the object space into a finite number of cells that form a grid structure on which all of the operations for clustering are performed. The main advantage of the approach is its fast processing time, which is typically independent of the number of data objects, yet dependent on only the number of cells in each dimension in the quantized space. In this section, we illustrate grid-based clustering using two typical examples. STING (Section 10.5.1) explores statistical information stored in the grid cells. CLIQUE (Section 10.5.2) represents a grid-and density-based approach for subspace clustering in a high-dimensional data space.
