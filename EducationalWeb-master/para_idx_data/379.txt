The index structure also facilitates the idea mentioned earlier: advanced text mining techniques are run on a smaller relevant subset of the entire dataset. For this, we can take the output from searching an inverted index and run (e.g.) topic modeling algorithms on the relevant documents. Thus, the analysis operators such as Select and Split take META's index objects as input and return objects such as a sequence. The algorithms that run for Select could be a filter or search engine, and Split could be meta::topics::lda_model or some other clustering algorithm.
