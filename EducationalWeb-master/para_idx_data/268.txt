To infer properties of entities associated with text data (i.e., discovery of knowledge about the world): as long as an entity can be associated with text data in some way, it is always potentially possible to use the text data to help categorize the associated entities. For example, we can use the English text data written by a person to predict whether the person is a non-native speaker of English. Prediction of party affiliation based on a political speech is another example. Naturally, in such a case, the task of text categorization is much harder as the "gap" between the category and text content is large. Indeed, in such an application, text categorization should really be called text-based prediction. These two somewhat different goals can also be distinguished based on the difference in the categories in each case. For the purpose of enriching text representation, the categories tend to be "internal" categories that characterize a text object (e.g., topical categories, sentiment categories). For the purpose of inferring properties of associated entities with text data, the categories tend to be "external" categories that characterize an entity associated with the text object (e.g., author attribution or any other meaningful categories associated with text data, potentially through indirect links). Computationally, however, these variations are all similar in that the input is a text object and the output is one or multiple categories. We thus do not further distinguish these different variations. The landscape of applications of text categorization is further enriched due to the variation we have in the text objects to be classified, which can include, e.g., documents, sentences, passages, or collections of text.
