In this book, we have studied principles and methods for mining relational data, data warehouses, and complex data types. Because data mining is a relatively young discipline with wide and diverse applications, there is still a nontrivial gap between general principles of data mining and application-specific, effective data mining tools. In this section, we examine several application domains, as listed in Figure 13.12. We discuss how customized data mining methods and tools should be developed for such applications.
