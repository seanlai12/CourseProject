The dissertation Mei [2009] has an excellent discussion of contextual text mining with many specific explorations of using context for text analysis, notably with topic modeling. Specifically, both the contextual probabilistic latent semantic analysis model ] and topic modeling with network as context [Mei et al. 2008] are discussed in detail in the dissertation. The iterative topic modeling approach with time series for supervision is described in Kim et al. [2013]. A general discussion of text-driven forecasting and its many applications can be found in Smith [2010]. Text and the companion structured data can often be generally modeled as an information network. A systematic discussion of algorithms for analyzing information networks can be found in Sun and Han [2012]. Interactive joint analysis of text and structured data can also be supported by combining the traditional Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) techniques with topic modeling to enable users to drill-down and roll-up in the "text dimension" using a hierarchical topic structure as described in Zhang et al. [2009].
