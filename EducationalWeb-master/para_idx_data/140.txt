Another common task is only returning documents that meet a certain criteria. For example, our index may store newspaper articles with dates as metadata. In our top-k search, suppose we want to only return documents that were written within the past year. This is a common document filtering problem. With term-at-a-time ranking, we can ignore documents that are not in the correct date range by not updating their scores in the score accumulator (thus not inserting those document IDs into the structure). In document-at-a-time ranking, we can simply skip the document if it doesn't pass the filter when creating the context for that particular document.
