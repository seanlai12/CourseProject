There exist many hidden roles or relationships among different nodes/links in a heterogeneous network. Examples include advisor-advisee and leader-follower relationships in a research publication network. To discover such hidden roles or relationships, experts can specify constraints based on their background knowledge. Enforcing such constraints may help cross-checking and validation in large interconnected networks. Information redundancy in a network can often be used to help weed out objects/links that do not follow such constraints. Similarly, link prediction can be performed based on the assessment of the ranking of the expected relationships among the candidate nodes/links. For example, we may predict which papers an author may write, read, or cite, based on the author's recent publication history and the trend of research on similar topics. Such studies often require analyzing the proximity of network nodes/links and the trends and connections of their similar neighbors. Roughly speaking, people refer to link prediction as link mining; however, link mining covers additional tasks including link-based object classification, object type prediction, link type prediction, link existence prediction, link cardinality estimation, and object reconciliation (which predicts whether two objects are, in fact, the same). It also includes group detection (which clusters objects), as well as subgraph identification (which finds characteristic subgraphs within networks) and metadata mining (which uncovers schema-type information regarding unstructured data).
