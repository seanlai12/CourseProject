Average precision is computed for just one query. Generally, though, we experiment with many different queries in order to capture the variance across them. For example, one system may perform very well with one query on which another system happens to perform poorly; using only this query would not give an accurate assessment of each systems' capability. Using more queries then requires the researcher to take an average of the average precision over all these queries. Naturally, we can simply calculate an arithmetic mean. In fact, this would give us what's called mean average precision (MAP). In this case, we take arithmetic mean of all the average precisions over several queries or topics. Let L = L 1 , L 2 , . . . , L m be the ranked lists returned from running m different queries. Then we have
