A simple measure of the distance between two vertices in a graph is the shortest path between the vertices. Formally, the geodesic distance between two vertices is the length in terms of the number of edges of the shortest path between the vertices. For two vertices that are not connected in a graph, the geodesic distance is defined as infinite. Using geodesic distance, we can define several other useful measurements for graph analysis and clustering. Given a graph G = (V , E), where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges, we define the following: For a vertext v ∈ V , the eccentricity of v, denoted eccen(v), is the largest geodesic distance between v and any other vertex u ∈ V − {v}. The eccentricity of v captures how far away v is from its remotest vertex in the graph. The radius of graph G is the minimum eccentricity of all vertices. That is, (11.27) The radius captures the distance between the "most central point" and the "farthest border" of the graph. The diameter of graph G is the maximum eccentricity of all vertices. That is, (11.28) The diameter represents the largest distance between any pair of vertices. A peripheral vertex is a vertex that achieves the diameter. Example 11.19 Measurements based on geodesic distance. Consider graph G in Figure 11.13. The eccentricity of a is 2, that is, eccen(a) = 2, eccen(b) = 2, and eccen(c) = eccen(d) = eccen(e) = 3. Thus, the radius of G is 2, and the diameter is 3. Note that it is not necessary that d = 2 × r. Vertices c, d, and e are peripheral vertices.
