Because of the required robustness and efficiency in TIS applications, in general, robust shallow NLP techniques tend to be more useful than fragile deep analysis techniques, which may hurt application performance due to inevitable analysis errors caused by the general difficulty of NLP. The limited value of deep NLP for some TIS tasks is further due to various ways to bypass the more difficult task of precisely understanding the meaning of natural language text and directly optimize the task performance. Thus, while improved NLP techniques should in general enable improved TIS task performance, lack of NLP capability isn't necessarily a major barrier for some application tasks, notably text retrieval, which is a relatively
