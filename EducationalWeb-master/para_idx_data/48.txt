Configuration files are an integral part of META's forward-facing infrastructure. They are designed such that exploratory analysis usually requires no programming effort from the user. By default, META is packaged with various executables that can be used to solve a particular task. For example, for a classification experiment the user would run the following command in their terminal 1 : ./classify config.toml This is standard procedure for using the default executables; they take only one configuration file parameter. The configuration file format is explained in detail later in this chapter, but essentially it allows the user to select a dataset, a way 1. Running the default classification experiment requires a dataset to operate on. The 20newsgroups dataset is specified in the default META config file and can be downloaded here: https:// meta-toolkit.org/data/20newsgroups.tar.gz. Place it in the meta/data/ directory.
