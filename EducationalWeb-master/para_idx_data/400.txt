In this chapter, we discuss techniques for joint analysis of text and structured data, which not only enriches text analysis, but is often necessary for many prediction problems involving both structured data and unstructured text data. Due to the complexity of many of these methods and the limited space, we will only give a brief introduction to the main ideas and show sample results to provide a sense about what kind of applications these techniques can support. Details of these techniques can be found in the references provided at the end of this chapter.
