Given a unigram language model θ estimated from this book's content, and two documents d 1 ="information retrieval" and d 2 ="retrieval information", then True or false? Why? 6.16. For this and the next question, refer to this probabilistic retrieval method called absolute discounting: where δ ∈ [0, 1] or |d| u is the total number of unique terms in a particular document d. What happens in the extreme cases where δ = 0 and δ = 1? 6.17. Does absolute discounting capture document length normalization? How? 6.18. Give two reasons why Dirichlet Prior smoothing is better than Add-1 smoothing, which is defined as
