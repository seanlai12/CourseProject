Human eyes are fast and effective at judging the quality of clustering methods for 2-D data. Can you design a data visualization method that may help humans visualize data clusters and judge the clustering quality for 3-D data? What about for even higher-dimensional data? 10.18 Suppose that you are to allocate a number of automatic teller machines (ATMs) in a given region so as to satisfy a number of constraints. Households or workplaces may be clustered so that typically one ATM is assigned per cluster. The clustering, however, may be constrained by two factors: (1) obstacle objects (i.e., there are bridges, rivers, and highways that can affect ATM accessibility), and (2) additional user-specified constraints such as that each ATM should serve at least 10,000 households. How can a clustering algorithm such as k-means be modified for quality clustering under both constraints?
