The vector space (VS) retrieval model is a simple, yet effective method of designing ranking functions for information retrieval. It is a special case of similarity-based models that we discussed previously, where we assume relevance is roughly correlated to similarity between a document and a query. Whether this assumption is the best way to capture the notion of relevance formally remains an open question, but in order to solve our search problem we have to convert the vague notion of relevance into a more precise definition that can be implemented with a programming language in one way or another. In this process we inevitably have to make a number of assumptions. Here we assume that if a document is more similar to a query than another document, then the first document would be assumed to be more relevant than the second one. This is the basis for ranking documents in the vector space model. This is not the only way to formalize relevance; we will see later there are other ways to model relevance. The basic idea of VS retrieval models is actually very easy to understand. Imagine a high dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a term; we can plot our documents in this space since they are represented as vectors of term magnitudes.
