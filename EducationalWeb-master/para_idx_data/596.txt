Spatial data mining discovers patterns and knowledge from spatial data. Spatial data, in many cases, refer to geospace-related data stored in geospatial data repositories. The data can be in "vector" or "raster" formats, or in the form of imagery and geo-referenced multimedia. Recently, large geographic data warehouses have been constructed by integrating thematic and geographically referenced data from multiple sources. From these, we can construct spatial data cubes that contain spatial dimensions and measures, and support spatial OLAP for multidimensional spatial data analysis. Spatial data mining can be performed on spatial data warehouses, spatial databases, and other geospatial data repositories. Popular topics on geographic knowledge discovery and spatial data mining include mining spatial associations and co-location patterns, spatial clustering, spatial classification, spatial modeling, and spatial trend and outlier analysis.
