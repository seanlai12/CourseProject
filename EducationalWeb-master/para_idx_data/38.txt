we could determine what kind of nouns are associated with what kind of verbs. This opens up more interesting opportunities for further analysis. Note in Figure 3.3 that we use a plus sign on the additional features because by representing text as a sequence of part of speech tags, we don't necessarily replace the original word sequence. Instead, we add this as an additional way of representing text data. Representing text as both words and POS tags enriches the representation of text data, enabling a deeper, more principled analysis. If we go further, then we'll be parsing the sentence to obtain a syntactic structure. Again, this further opens up more interesting analysis of, for example, the writing styles or grammatical error correction. If we go further still into semantic analysis, then we might be able to recognize dog as an animal. We also can recognize boy as a person, and playground as a location and analyze their relations. One deduction could be that the dog was chasing the boy, and the boy is on the playground. This will add more entities and relations, through entity-relation recognition. Now, we can count the most frequent person that appears in this whole collection of news articles. Or, whenever you see a mention of this person you also tend to see mentions of another person or object. These types of repeated pattens can potentially make very good features.
