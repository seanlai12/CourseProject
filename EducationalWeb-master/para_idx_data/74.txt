A broader discussion of supporting information access via a digital library is available in Gon√ßalves et al. [2004]. The relation between retrieval ("pull") and filtering ("push") has been discussed in the article Belkin and Croft [1992]. The contrast between information retrieval and database search was discussed in the classic in-Exercises 85 formation retrieval book by van Rijsbergen [1979]. [Hearst 2009] has a systematic discussion of user interfaces of a search system, which is relevant to the design of interfaces for any information system in general; in particular, many visualization techniques that can facilitate browsing and querying are discussed in the book. Exploratory search is a particular type of search tasks that often requires multimodal information access including both querying and browsing. It was covered in a special issue of Communications of ACM [White et al. 2006], and White and Roth [2009]. The probability ranking principle [Robertson 1997] is generally regarded as the theoretical foundation for framing the retrieval problem as a ranking problem. More historical work related to this, as well as a set of important research papers in IR up to 1997, can be found in Readings in Information Retrieval [Sparck Jones and Willett 1997]. A brief survey of IR history can be found in Sanderson and Croft [2012].
