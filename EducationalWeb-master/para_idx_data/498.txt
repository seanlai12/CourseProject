Suppose you have assessed the clustering tendency of a given data set. You may have also tried to predetermine the number of clusters in the set. You can now apply one or multiple clustering methods to obtain clusterings of the data set. "How good is the clustering generated by a method, and how can we compare the clusterings generated by different methods?" We have a few methods to choose from for measuring the quality of a clustering. In general, these methods can be categorized into two groups according to whether ground truth is available. Here, ground truth is the ideal clustering that is often built using human experts. If ground truth is available, it can be used by extrinsic methods, which compare the clustering against the group truth and measure. If the ground truth is unavailable, we can use intrinsic methods, which evaluate the goodness of a clustering by considering how well the clusters are separated. Ground truth can be considered as supervision in the form of "cluster labels." Hence, extrinsic methods are also known as supervised methods, while intrinsic methods are unsupervised methods. Let's have a look at simple methods from each category.
