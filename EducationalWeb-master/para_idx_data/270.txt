Let's take our intuitive understanding of categorizing documents and rewrite the example from Chapter 2 into a more mathematical form. Let our collection of documents be X; perhaps they are stored in a forward index (see Chapter 8). Therefore, one x i âˆˆ X is a term vector of features that represent document i. As with our retrieval setup, each x i has |x i | = |V | (one dimension for each feature, as assigned by the tokenizer). Our vector from Chapter 8 is an example of such an x i with a very small vocabulary of size |V | = 8.
