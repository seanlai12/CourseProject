Some advanced abstractive methods rely more heavily on natural language processing to build a model of the document to summarize. Named entity recognition can be used to extract people, places, or businesses from the text. Dependency parsers and other syntactic techniques can be used to find the relation between the entities 324 Chapter 16 Text Summarization and the actions they perform. Once these actors and roles are discovered, they are stored in some internal representation. To generate the actual text, some representations are chosen from the parsed collection, and English sentences are created based on them; this is called realization. Such realization systems have much more fine-grained control over the generated text than the basic abstractive language model generator described above. A templated document structure may exist (such as intro→paragraph 1→paragraph 2→conclusion), and the structures are chosen to fill each spot. This control over text summarization and layout enables an easily-readable summary since it has a natural topical flow. In this environment, it would be possible to merge similar sentences with conjunctions such as and or but, depending on the context. To make the summary sound even more natural, pronouns can be used instead of entity names if the entity name has already been mentioned. Below are examples of these two operations: Gold prices fell today. Silver prices fell today. → Gold and silver prices fell today. Company A lost 9.43% today. Company A was the biggest mover. → Company A lost 9.43% today. It was the biggest mover.
