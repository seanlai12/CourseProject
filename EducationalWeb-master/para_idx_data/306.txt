Summarize the input document using the generator. Experiment with different stopping criteria. Which seems to work the best? 328 Chapter 16 Text Summarization 16.9. Create some simple post-processing rules for natural language generation realization. The examples we gave in the text were sentence joining and pronoun insertion. What else can you think of? 16.10. Explain how we can combine text summarization and topic modeling to create a powerful exploratory text mining application. 16.11. What can we accomplish by interpolating a language model distribution for an abstractive summarizer with another probability distribution, perhaps from existing summaries? This chapter is about topic mining and analysis, covering a family of unsupervised text mining techniques called probabilistic topic models that can be used to discover latent topics in text data. A topic is something that we all understand intuitively, but it's actually not easy to formally define it. Roughly speaking, a topic is the main idea discussed in text data, which may also be regarded as a theme or subject of a discussion or conversation. A topic can have different granularities. For example, we can talk about the topic of a sentence, the topic of an article, the topic of a paragraph, or the topic of all the research articles in a library. Different granularities of topics have different applications. There are many applications that require discovery and analysis of topics in text. For example, we might be interested in knowing about what Twitter users are talking about today. Are they talking about NBA sports, international events, or another topic? We may also be interested in knowing about research topics; one might be interested in knowing the current research topics in data mining, and how they are different from those five years ago. To answer such questions, we need to discover topics in the data mining literature, including specifically topics in today's literature and those in the past so that we can make a comparison. We might also be interested in knowing what people like about some products, such as smartphones. This requires discovering topics in both positive reviews and negative reviews. Or, perhaps we're interested in knowing what the major topics debated in a presidential election are. All these have to do with discovering topics in text and analyzing them. How to do this is a main topic of this chapter. We can view a topic as describing some knowledge about the world as shown in Figure 17.1. From text data, we want to discover a number of topics which can provide a description about the world. That is, a topic tells us something about the world (e.g., about a product or a person). Besides text data, we often also have some non-text data which can be used as additional context for analyzing the topics. We might know the time associated Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor.

All such metadata (or context variables) can be associated with the topics that we discover, and we can then use these context variables to analyze topic patterns. For example, looking at topics over time, we would be able to discover whether there's a trending topic or some topics might be fading away. Similarly, looking at topics in different locations might help reveal insights about people's opinions in different locations. Let's look at the tasks of topic mining and analysis. As shown in Figure 17.2, topic analysis first involves discovering a number of topics. In this case, there are k topics. We also would like to know which topics are covered in which documents, and to what extent. For example, in Doc 1, the visualization shows that Topic 1 is well covered while Topic 2 and Topic k are covered with a small portion. Doc 2, on the other hand, covered Topic 2 very well but it did not cover Topic 1 at all. It also covers Topic k to some extent. Thus, there are generally two different tasks or subtasks: the first is to discover the k topics from a collection of text; the second task is to figure out which documents cover which topics to what extent. More formally, we can define the problem as shown in Figure 17.3. First, we have as input a collection of N text documents. Here we can denote the text collection as C, and denote a text article as d i . We also need to have as input the number of topics, k, though this number may be potentially set automatically based on data characteristics. However, in the techniques that we will discuss in this chapter, we need to specify a number of topics.
