to tokenize the dataset, and a particular classification algorithm to run (for this example). If more advanced functionality is desired, programming in C++ is required to make calls to META's API (applications programming interface). Both configuration file and API usage are documented on META's website, https://meta-toolkit.org as well as in this chapter. Additionally, a forum for META exists (https://forum.metatoolkit.org), containing discussion surrounding the toolkit. It includes user support topics, community-written documentation, and developer discussions. The sections that follow delve into a little more detail about particular aspects of META so the reader will be comfortable working with it in future chapters.
