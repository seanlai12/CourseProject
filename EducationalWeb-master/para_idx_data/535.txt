In some applications, we want to cluster both objects and attributes simultaneously. The resulting clusters are known as biclusters and meet four requirements: (1) only a small set of objects participate in a cluster; (2) a cluster only involves a small number of attributes; (3) an object may participate in multiple clusters, or does not participate in any cluster; and (4) an attribute may be involved in multiple clusters, or is not involved in any cluster. Section 11.2.3 discusses biclustering in detail.
