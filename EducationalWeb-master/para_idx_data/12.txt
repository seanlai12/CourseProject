The Kolmogorov axioms describe facts about probability distributions in general (both discrete and continuous). We discuss them now, since they are a good sanity check when designing your own models. A valid probability distribution θ with probability space must satisfy the following three axioms. . Each event has a probability between zero and one: 0 ≤ p θ (ω ∈ ) ≤ 1. (2.1) . An event not in has probability zero, and the probability of any event occurring from is one: p θ (ω ) = 0, ω ∈ and p θ ( ) = 1. (2.2) . The probability of all (disjoint) events sums to one: ω∈ p θ (ω) = 1. (2.3) Note that, strictly speaking, an event is defined as a subset of the probability space , and we say that an event happens if and only if the outcome from a random experiment (i.e., randomly drawing an outcome from ) is in the corresponding subset of outcomes defined by the event. Thus, it is easy to understand that the special event corresponding to the empty subset is an impossible event with a probability of zero, whereas the special event corresponding to the complete set itself always happens and so has a probability of 1.0. As a special case, we can consider an event space with only those events that each have precisely one element of outcome, which is exactly what we assumed when talking about a distribution over all the words. Here each word corresponds to the event defined by the subset with the word as the only element; clearly, such an event happens if and only if the outcome is the corresponding word.
