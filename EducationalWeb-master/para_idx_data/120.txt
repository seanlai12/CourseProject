After we have performed these operations, we will get a new query vector which can be used again to score documents in the index. This new query vector will then reflect the move of the original query vector toward the relevant centroid vector and away from the non-relevant centroid vector. Let's take a look at a detailed example depicted below. Imagine we have a small vocabulary, V = {news, about, presidential, campaign, food, text} and a query q = {1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0}. Recall from Chapter 6 that our vocabulary V is a fixed-length term vector. It's not necessary to know what type of weighting scheme this search engine is using, since in Rocchio feedback, we will only be adding and subtracting term weights from the query vector. Say we are given five feedback documents whose term vectors are denoted as relevant with a + prefix. The negative feedback documents are prefixed with âˆ’. Now that we have the two centroids, we modify the original query to create the expanded query q m :
