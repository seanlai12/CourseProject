(1) arbitrarily choose k objects in D as the initial representative objects or seeds; (2) repeat (3) assign each remaining object to the cluster with the nearest representative object; (4) randomly select a nonrepresentative object, o random ; (5) compute the total cost, S, of swapping representative object, o j , with o random ; (6) if S < 0 then swap o j with o random to form the new set of k representative objects; (7) until no change; Figure 10.5 PAM, a k-medoids partitioning algorithm. is one of the best k-medoids but is not selected during sampling, CLARA will never find the best clustering. (You will be asked to provide an example demonstrating this as an exercise.) "How might we improve the quality and scalability of CLARA?" Recall that when searching for better medoids, PAM examines every object in the data set against every current medoid, whereas CLARA confines the candidate medoids to only a random sample of the data set. A randomized algorithm called CLARANS (Clustering Large Applications based upon RANdomized Search) presents a trade-off between the cost and the effectiveness of using samples to obtain clustering. First, it randomly selects k objects in the data set as the current medoids. It then randomly selects a current medoid x and an object y that is not one of the current medoids. Can replacing x by y improve the absolute-error criterion? If yes, the replacement is made. CLARANS conducts such a randomized search l times. The set of the current medoids after the l steps is considered a local optimum. CLARANS repeats this randomized process m times and returns the best local optimal as the final result.
