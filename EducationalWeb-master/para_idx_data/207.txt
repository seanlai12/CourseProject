In this section, we provide a high-level description of the landscape of various text mining tasks, which also serves as a roadmap for the topics to be covered in the subsequent chapters in Part III. Figure 12.4 shows the process of generating text data in more detail. Specifically, a human sensor or human observer would look at the world from some perspective. Different people would be looking at the world from different angles and they'll pay attention to different things. The same person at different times might also pay attention to different aspects of the observed world. Each human-a sensorwould then form their own view of the world. This would be different from the real world because the perspective that the person has taken can often be biased. The observed world can be represented as (for example) entity-relation graphs or using
