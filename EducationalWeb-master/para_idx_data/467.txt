Partitioning methods -Find mutually exclusive clusters of spherical shape -Distance-based -May use mean or medoid (etc.) to represent cluster center -Effective for small-to medium-size data sets Hierarchical methods -Clustering is a hierarchical decomposition (i.e., multiple levels) -Cannot correct erroneous merges or splits -May incorporate other techniques like microclustering or consider object "linkages" Density-based methods -Can find arbitrarily shaped clusters -Clusters are dense regions of objects in space that are separated by low-density regions -Cluster density: Each point must have a minimum number of points within its "neighborhood" -May filter out outliers Grid-based methods -Use a multiresolution grid data structure -Fast processing time (typically independent of the number of data objects, yet dependent on grid size) Figure 10.1 Overview of clustering methods discussed in this chapter. Note that some algorithms may combine various methods.
