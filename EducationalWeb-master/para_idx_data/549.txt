For some applications, geodesic distance may be inappropriate in measuring the similarity between vertices in a graph. Here we introduce SimRank, a similarity measure based on random walk and on the structural context of the graph. In mathematics, a random walk is a trajectory that consists of taking successive random steps. Example 11.20 Similarity between people in a social network. Let's consider measuring the similarity between two vertices in the AllElectronics customer social network of Example 11.18. Here, similarity can be explained as the closeness between two participants in the network, that is, how close two people are in terms of the relationship represented by the social network. "How well can the geodesic distance measure similarity and closeness in such a network?" Suppose Ada and Bob are two customers in the network, and the network is undirected. The geodesic distance (i.e., the length of the shortest path between Ada and Bob) is the shortest path that a message can be passed from Ada to Bob and vice versa. However, this information is not useful for AllElectronics' customer relationship management because the company typically does not want to send a specific message from one customer to another. Therefore, geodesic distance does not suit the application. "What does similarity mean in a social network?" We consider two ways to define similarity: Two customers are considered similar to one another if they have similar neighbors in the social network. This heuristic is intuitive because, in practice, two people receiving recommendations from a good number of common friends often make similar decisions. This kind of similarity is based on the local structure (i.e., the neighborhoods) of the vertices, and thus is called structural context-based similarity.
