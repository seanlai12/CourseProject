In this section, we're going to continue our discussion of web search, particularly focusing on how to utilize links between pages to improve search. In the previous section, we talked about how to create a large index on using MapReduce on GFS. Now that we have our index, we want to see how we can improve ranking of pages on the web. Of course, standard IR models can be applied here; in fact, they are important building blocks for supporting web search, but they aren't sufficient for the following reasons. First, on the web we tend to have very different information needs. For example, people might search for a web page or entry page-this is different from the traditional library search where people are primarily interested in collecting literature information. These types of queries are often called navigational queries, where the purpose is to navigate into a particular targeted page. For such queries, we might benefit from using link information. For example, navigational queries could be facebook or yahoo finance. The user is simply trying to get to those pages without explicitly typing in the URL in the address bar of the browser. Secondly, web documents have much more information than pure text; there is hierarchical organization and annotations such as the page layout, title, or hyperlinks to other pages. These features provide an opportunity to use extra context information of the document to improve scoring. Finally, information quality greatly varies. All this means we have to consider many factors to improve the standard ranking algorithm, giving us a more robust way to rank the pages and making it more difficult for spammers to manipulate one signal to improve a single page's ranking.
