We now have the likelihood function determined for a distribution with k outcomes. The conjugate prior to the multinomial is the Dirichlet. That is, if we use a Dirichlet prior, the posterior will also be a Dirichlet. Like the multinomial, the Dirichlet is a distribution over positive vectors that sum to one. (The "simplex" is the name of the space where these vectors live.) Like the Beta distribution, the parameters of the Dirichlet are reals. Here's the pdf: (A.13) In this notation we have p(θ | α). θ is what we draw from the Dirichlet; in the Beta, it was the parameter to be used in the binomial. Here, it is the vector of parameters to be used in the multinomial. In this sense, the Dirichlet is a distribution that produces distributions (so is the Beta!). The hyperparameters of the Dirichlet are also a vector (denoted with an arrow for emphasis). Instead of just two hyperparameters as in the Beta, the Dirichlet needs k-one for each multinomial probability.
