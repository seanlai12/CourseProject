Because text data are created for consumption by humans, humans play an important role in text data analysis and management applications. Specifically, humans can help select the most relevant data to a particular application problem, which is beneficial since it enables us to avoid processing the huge amount of raw text data (which would be inefficient) and focus on analyzing the most relevant part. Selecting relevant text data from a large collection is the basic task of text access. This selection is generally based on a specification of the information need of an analyst (a user), and can be done in two modes: pull and push. Figure 5.1 describes how these modes fit together along with querying and browsing.
