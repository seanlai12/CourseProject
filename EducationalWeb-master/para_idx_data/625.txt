The diversity of data, data mining tasks, and data mining approaches poses many challenging research issues in data mining. The development of efficient and effective data mining methods, systems and services, and interactive and integrated data mining environments is a key area of study. The use of data mining techniques to solve large or sophisticated application problems is an important task for data mining researchers and data mining system and application developers. This section describes some of the trends in data mining that reflect the pursuit of these challenges. Application exploration: Early data mining applications put a lot of effort into helping businesses gain a competitive edge. The exploration of data mining for businesses continues to expand as e-commerce and e-marketing have become mainstream in the retail industry. Data mining is increasingly used for the exploration of applications in other areas such as web and text analysis, financial analysis, industry, government, biomedicine, and science. Emerging application areas include data mining for counterterrorism and mobile (wireless) data mining. Because generic data mining systems may have limitations in dealing with application-specific problems, we may see a trend toward the development of more application-specific data mining systems and tools, as well as invisible data mining functions embedded in various kinds of services.
