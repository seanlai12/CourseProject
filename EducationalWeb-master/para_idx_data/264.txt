Cluster labeling is an active research field. Brainstorm some ideas how to assign cluster labels when clustering documents and when clustering terms. A good cluster-labeling algorithm would probably include some formulas based on term or cluster statistics. Exercises 297 14.5. Consider all three cluster-cluster similarity metrics discussed in this chapter. Which of them is most likely to form "chains" of documents as opposed to a tighter group? Why? 14.6. Implement K-means or hierarchical agglomerative clustering in META. Make your algorithm general to any bag-of-words tokenization method by clustering already-analyzed documents. 14.7. Design a heuristic to set the number of clusters (and their contents) given a dendrogram of hierarchically clustered data. Try to make your algorithm run in only one traversal of the tree. 14.8. Using the topic language models for semantic relatedness, rewrite the scoring function using each of Dirichlet prior and Jelinek-Mercer smoothing. That is, smooth p(w | C) in the following function: 14.9. What are the maximum and minimum values of (unnormalized) PMI?
