In this section, we study graphic displays of basic statistical descriptions. These include quantile plots, quantile-quantile plots, histograms, and scatter plots. Such graphs are helpful for the visual inspection of data, which is useful for data preprocessing. The first three of these show univariate distributions (i.e., data for one attribute), while scatter plots show bivariate distributions (i.e., involving two attributes).
