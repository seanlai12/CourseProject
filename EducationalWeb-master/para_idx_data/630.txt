This chapter presented an overview of sequence pattern mining and graph pattern mining methods. Mining tree patterns and partial order patterns is also studied in research. Summarize the methods for mining structured patterns, including sequences, trees, graphs, and partial order relationships. Examine what kinds of structural pattern mining have not been covered in research. Propose applications that can be created for such new mining problems.
