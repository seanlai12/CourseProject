If a small category is split into small pieces in a clustering, those small pieces may likely become noise and thus the small category cannot be discovered from the clustering. The small cluster preservation criterion states that splitting a small category into pieces is more harmful than splitting a large category into pieces. Consider an extreme case. Let D be a data set of n + 2 objects such that, according to ground truth, n objects, denoted by o 1 , . . . , o n , belong to one category and the other two objects, denoted by o n+1 ,o n+2 , belong to another category. Suppose clustering C 1 has three clusters, C 1 = {o 1 , . . . , o n }, C 2 = {o n+1 }, and C 3 = {o n+2 }. Let clustering C 2 have three clusters, too, namely C 1 = {o 1 , . . . , o n−1 }, C 2 = {o n }, and C 3 = {o n+1 , o n+2 }. In other words, C 1 splits the small category and C 2 splits the big category. A clustering quality measure Q preserving small clusters should give a higher score to C 2 , that is, Q(C 2 , C g ) > Q(C 1 , C g ). Many clustering quality measures satisfy some of these four criteria. Here, we introduce the BCubed precision and recall metrics, which satisfy all four criteria. BCubed evaluates the precision and recall for every object in a clustering on a given data set according to ground truth. The precision of an object indicates how many other objects in the same cluster belong to the same category as the object. The recall 10.6 Evaluation of Clustering 489 of an object reflects how many objects of the same category are assigned to the same cluster. Formally, let D = {o 1 , . . . , o n } be a set of objects, and C be a clustering on D. Let L(o i ) (1 ≤ i ≤ n) be the category of o i given by ground truth, and C(o i ) be the cluster ID of o i in C. Then, for two objects, o i and o j , (1 ≤ i, j, ≤ n, i = j), the correctness of the relation between o i and o j in clustering C is given by BCubed precision is defined as BCubed recall is defined as (10.30)
