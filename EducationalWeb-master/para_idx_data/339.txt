We've mentioned the original PLSA paper [Hofmann 1999] and its successor LDA [Blei et al. 2003]. Asuncion et al. [2009] compares various inference methods for topic models and concludes that they are all very similar. For evaluation, we've referenced Chang et al. [2009] in this chapter, and it showed that convenient mathematical measures such as log-likelihood are not correlated with human measures. For books, Koller and Friedman [2009] is a large and detailed introduction to probabilistic graphical models. Bishop [2006] covers graphical models, mixture models, EM, and inference in the larger scope of machine learning. Steyvers and Griffiths
