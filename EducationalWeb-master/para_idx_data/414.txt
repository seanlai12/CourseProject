where F = {d 1 , . . . , d k } is the set of feedback documents, and λ is yet another parameter that indicates the amount of "background noise" in the feedback documents, and that needs to be set empirically. Now, given λ, the feedback documents F , and the collection language model p(w | C), we can use the EM algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimate of θ F , as detailed in Appendix B.
