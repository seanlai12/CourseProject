These techniques analyze experimental data for two or more populations described by a numeric response variable and one or more categorical variables (factors). In general, an ANOVA (single-factor analysis of variance) problem involves a comparison of k population or treatment means to determine if at least two of the means are different. More complex ANOVA problems also exist. Mixed-effect models: These models are for analyzing grouped data-data that can be classified according to one or more grouping variables. They typically describe relationships between a response variable and some covariates in data grouped according to one or more factors. Common areas of application include multilevel data, repeated measures data, block designs, and longitudinal data. Factor analysis: This method is used to determine which variables are combined to generate a given factor. For example, for many psychiatric data, it is not possible to measure a certain factor of interest directly (e.g., intelligence); however, it is often possible to measure other quantities (e.g., student test scores) that reflect the factor of interest. Here, none of the variables is designated as dependent.
