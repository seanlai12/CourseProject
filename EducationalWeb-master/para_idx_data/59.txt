Grammatical parse trees represent deeper syntactic knowledge from text sentences. They represent sentence phrase hierarchy as a tree structure. Consider the example in Figure 4.1. The parse tree is rooted with S, denoting Sentence; the sentence is composed of a noun phrase (NP) followed by a verb phrase (VP) and period. The leaves of the tree are the words in the sentence, and the preterminals (the direct parents of the leaves) are part-of-speech tags. Some common features from a parse tree are production rules such as S â†’ NP V P , tree depth, and structural tree features. Syntactic categories (node labels) alone can also be used. The following command runs the parser on each sentence in the input file: ./profile config.toml two-cities.txt --parse Like POS-tagging, the parsing may also take a minute or two to complete.
