All processed data in META is stored in an index. There are two index types: forward_index and inverted_index. The former is keyed by document IDs, and the latter is keyed by term IDs. forward_index is used for applications such as topic modeling and most classification tasks. inverted_index is used to create search engines, or do classification with knearest-neighbor or similar algorithms. Since each META application takes an index as input, all processed data is interchangeable between all the components. This also gives a great advantage to classification: META supports out-of-core classification by default! If a dataset is small enough (like most other toolkits assume), a cache can be used such as no_ evict_cache to keep it all in memory without sacrificing any speed. (Index usage is explained in much more detail in the search engine exercises.) There are four corpus input formats. line_corpus. each dataset consists of one to three files: corpusname.dat. each document appears on one line corpusname.dat.labels. optional file that includes the class or label of the document on each line, again corresponding to the order in corpusname.dat. These are the labels that are used for the classification tasks. file_corpus. each document is its own file, and the name of the file becomes the name of the document. There is also a corpusname-full-corpus.txt For more information on corpus storage and configuration settings, we suggest the reader consult https://meta-toolkit.org/overview-tutorial.html.
