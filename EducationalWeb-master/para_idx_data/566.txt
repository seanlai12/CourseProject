Spectral clustering is a dimensionality reduction method. The general idea is to construct new dimensions using an affinity matrix. Clustering graph and network data has many applications such as social network analysis. Challenges include how to measure the similarity between objects in a graph, and how to design clustering models and methods for graph and network data. Geodesic distance is the number of edges between two vertices on a graph. It can be used to measure similarity. Alternatively, similarity in graphs, such as social networks, can be measured using structural context and random walk. SimRank is a similarity measure that is based on both structural context and random walk. Graph clustering can be modeled as computing graph cuts. A sparsest cut may lead to a good clustering, while modularity can be used to measure the clustering quality. SCAN is a graph clustering algorithm that searches graphs to identify well-connected components as clusters. Constraints can be used to express application-specific requirements or background knowledge for cluster analysis. Constraints for clustering can be categorized as constraints on instances, on clusters, or on similarity measurement. Constraints on instances include must-link and cannot-link constraints. A constraint can be hard or soft. Hard constraints for clustering can be enforced by strictly respecting the constraints in the cluster assignment process. Clustering with soft constraints can be considered an optimization problem. Heuristics can be used to speed up constrained clustering. 11.6 Exercises 11.1 Traditional clustering methods are rigid in that they require each object to belong exclusively to only one cluster. Explain why this is a special case of fuzzy clustering. You may use k-means as an example.
