(1) create a cluster for each object C i = {o i }, 1 ≤ i ≤ n; (2) for i = 1 to n fit the observed data. Neither algorithmic approaches nor probabilistic approaches can find the distribution of such hierarchies. Recently, Bayesian tree-structured models have been developed to handle such problems. Bayesian and other sophisticated probabilistic clustering methods are considered advanced topics and are not covered in this book.
