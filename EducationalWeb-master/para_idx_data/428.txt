Variance and standard deviation are measures of data dispersion. They indicate how spread out a data distribution is. A low standard deviation means that the data observations tend to be very close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data are spread out over a large range of values. The variance of N observations, x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x N , for a numeric attribute X is wherex is the mean value of the observations, as defined in Eq. (2.1). The standard deviation, σ , of the observations is the square root of the variance, σ 2 . Example 2.12 Variance and standard deviation. In Example 2.6, we foundx = $58,000 using Eq. (2.1) for the mean. To determine the variance and standard deviation of the data from that example, we set N = 12 and use Eq. (2.6) to obtain The basic properties of the standard deviation, σ , as a measure of spread are as follows: σ measures spread about the mean and should be considered only when the mean is chosen as the measure of center. σ = 0 only when there is no spread, that is, when all observations have the same value. Otherwise, σ > 0. Importantly, an observation is unlikely to be more than several standard deviations away from the mean. Mathematically, using Chebyshev's inequality, it can be shown that at least 1 − 1 k 2 × 100% of the observations are no more than k standard deviations from the mean. Therefore, the standard deviation is a good indicator of the spread of a data set. The computation of the variance and standard deviation is scalable in large databases.
