An abstractive summary creates sentences that did not exist in the original document or documents. Instead of a document vector, we will use a language model to represent the original text. Unlike the document vector, our language model gives us a principled way in which to generate text. Imagine we tokenized our document with unigram words. In our language model, we would have a parameter representing the probability of each word occurring. To create our own text, we will draw words from this probability distribution.
