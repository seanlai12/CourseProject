TEXTOBJECTSET → TOPICSET. The TopicExtraction operator maps a set of text objects into a set of topics. Interpret. {TOPIC, TEXTOBJECTSET} → TEXTOBJECTSET. The Interpret operator maps a topic and a set of text objects into another set of text objects. Compare. {TEXTOBJECTSET, . . . , TEXTOBJECTSET} → TOPICSET, . . . , TOPICSET. The Compare operator maps a set of comparable sets of text objects into a set of common topics covered in all the comparable sets of text objects, and sets of context-specific topics. The formalization of some of the operators is illustrated in Figure 20.4, where θ denotes a weighted word vector. Even with these few operators, we already have some interesting combinations. For example, in Figure 20 combination of multiple topic selections followed by a comparison operator, which would then be followed by an Interpret operator. In Figure 20.6, we show another example of combination of a Split operator followed by a comparison operator, which would then be followed by an Interpret operator. It is easy to imagine that there are many other ways to combine these operators.
