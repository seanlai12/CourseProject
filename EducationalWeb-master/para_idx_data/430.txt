In this and the following subsections, we cover common graphic displays of data distributions. A quantile plot is a simple and effective way to have a first look at a univariate data distribution. First, it displays all of the data for the given attribute (allowing the user to assess both the overall behavior and unusual occurrences). Second, it plots quantile information (see Section 2.2.2). Let x i , for i = 1 to N , be the data sorted in increasing order so that x 1 is the smallest observation and x N is the largest for some ordinal or numeric attribute X. Each observation, x i , is paired with a percentage, f i , which indicates that approximately f i × 100% of the data are below the value, x i . We say "approximately" because there may not be a value with exactly a fraction, f i , of the data below x i . Note that the 0.25 percentile corresponds to quartile Q 1 , the 0.50 percentile is the median, and the 0.75 percentile is Q 3 . Let (2.7) These numbers increase in equal steps of 1/N , ranging from 1 2N (which is slightly above 0) to 1 − 1 2N (which is slightly below 1). On a quantile plot, x i is graphed against f i . This allows us to compare different distributions based on their quantiles. For example, given the quantile plots of sales data for two different time periods, we can compare their Q 1 , median, Q 3 , and other f i values at a glance. Example 2.13 Quantile plot. Figure 2.4 shows a quantile plot for the unit price data of Table 2.1.
