Suppose we want to find k probabilistic clusters, C 1 , . . . , C k , through cluster analysis. For a data set, D, of n objects, we can regard D as a finite sample of the possible instances of the clusters. Conceptually, we can assume that D is formed as follows. Each cluster, C j (1 ≤ j ≤ k), is associated with a probability, ω j , that some instance is sampled from the cluster. It is often assumed that ω 1 , . . . , ω k are given as part of the problem setting, and that k j=1 ω j = 1, which ensures that all objects are generated by the k clusters. Here, parameter ω j captures background knowledge about the relative population of cluster C j . We then run the following two steps to generate an object in D. The steps are executed n times in total to generate n objects, o 1 , . . . , o n , in D. 1. Choose a cluster, C j , according to probabilities ω 1 , . . . , ω k .
