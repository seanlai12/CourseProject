We are now ready to discuss our first general clustering strategy. This method progressively constructs clusters to generate a hierarchy of merged groups. This bottom-up (agglomerative) approach gradually groups similar objects (single documents or groups of documents) into larger and larger clusters until there is only one cluster left. The tree may then be segmented as needed. Alternatively, the merging may be stopped when the desired number of clusters is found. This series of merges forms a dendrogram, represented in Figure 14.2. In the figure, the original documents are numbered one through eleven and comprise the bottom row of the dendrogram. Circles represent clusters of more than one document, and lines represent which documents or clusters were merged together to form the next, larger cluster. The clustering algorithm is straightforward: while there is more than one cluster, find the two most similar clusters and merge them. This does present an issue though when we need to compare the similarity of a cluster with a cluster, or a cluster with a single document. Until now, we have only defined similarity measures that take two documents as input. To simplify this problem, we will treat individual documents as clusters; thus we only need to compare clusters for similarity. The cluster similarity measures we define make use of the document-document similarity measures presented previously. 281   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  Single-link merges the two clusters with the smallest minimum distance. This results in "looser" clusters, since we only need to find two individually close elements in each cluster in order to perform the merge.
