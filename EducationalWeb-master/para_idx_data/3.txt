In the last two decades, we have experienced an explosive growth of online information. According to a study done at University of California Berkeley back in 2003: ". . . the world produces between 1 and 2 exabytes (1018 petabytes) of unique information per year, which is roughly 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds comprise only .03% of the total." [Lyman et al. 2003] A large amount of online information is textual information (i.e., in natural language text). For example, according to the Berkeley study cited above: "Newspapers represent 25 terabytes annually, magazines represent 10 terabytes . . . office documents represent 195 terabytes. It is estimated that 610 billion emails are sent each year representing 11,000 terabytes." Of course, there are also blog articles, forum posts, tweets, scientific literature, government documents, etc. Roe [2012] updates the email count from 610 billion emails in 2003 to 107 trillion emails sent in 2010. According to a recent IDC report report [Gantz & Reinsel 2012], from 2005 to 2020, the digital universe will grow by a factor of 300, from 130 exabytes to 40,000 exabytes, or 40 trillion gigabytes. While, in general, all kinds of online information are useful, textual information plays an especially important role and is arguably the most useful kind of information for the following reasons.
