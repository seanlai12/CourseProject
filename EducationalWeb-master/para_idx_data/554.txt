This section studies how to categorize the constraints used in cluster analysis. Specifically, we can categorize constraints according to the subjects on which they are set, or on how strongly the constraints are to be enforced. As discussed in Chapter 10, cluster analysis involves three essential aspects: objects as instances of clusters, clusters as groups of objects, and the similarity among objects. Therefore, the first method we discuss categorizes constraints according to what they are applied to. We thus have three types: constraints on instances, constraints on clusters, and constraints on similarity measurement.
