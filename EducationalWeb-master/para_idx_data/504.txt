Suppose that the data mining task is to cluster points (with (x, y) representing location) into three clusters, where the points are A 1 (2, 10), A 2 (2, 5), A 3 (8, 4), B 1 (5, 8), B 2 (7, 5), B 3 (6, 4), C 1 (1, 2), C 2 (4, 9). The distance function is Euclidean distance. Suppose initially we assign A 1 , B 1 , and C 1 as the center of each cluster, respectively. Use the k-means algorithm to show only (a) The three cluster centers after the first round of execution. (b) The final three clusters.
