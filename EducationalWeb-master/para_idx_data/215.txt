What words tend to occur to the left of "eats"? Whenever "eats" occurs, what other words also tend to occur? How helpful is the occurrence of "eats" for predicting occurrence of "meat"? How helpful is the occurrence of "eats" for predicting occurrence of "text"? What words to the right? My _ eats _ on Saturday His _ eats _ on Tuesday My _ eats _ on Sunday His _ eats _ on Tuesday â€¦ generally help us predict whether meat also occurs. This is the intuition we would like to capture. In other words, if we see eats occur in the sentence, that should increase the chance that meat would also occur. In contrast, if you look at the question at the bottom, how helpful is the occurrence of eats for predicting an occurrence of text? Because eats and text are not really related, knowing whether eats occurred in the sentence doesn't really help us predict whether text also occurs in the sentence. Essentially, we need to capture the correlation between the occurrences of two words. In summary, paradigmatic relations consider each word by its context and we can compute the context similarity. We assume the words that have high context similarity will have a high paradigmatic relation. For syntagmatic relations, we will count how many times two words occur together in a context, which can be a sentence, a paragraph, or even a document. We compare their co-occurrences with their individual occurrences. We assume words with high co-occurrences but relatively low individual occurrences will have a syntagmatic relation because they tend to occur together and they don't usually occur alone. Note that paradigmatic relations and syntagmatic relations are closely related in that paradigmatically related words tend to have a syntagmatic relation with the same word. This fact suggests that we can perform a joint discovery of the two relations.
