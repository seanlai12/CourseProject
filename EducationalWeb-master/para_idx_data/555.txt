A constraint on instances specifies how a pair or a set of instances should be grouped in the cluster analysis. Two common types of constraints from this category include: Must-link constraints. If a must-link constraint is specified on two objects x and y, then x and y should be grouped into one cluster in the output of the cluster analysis. These must-link constraints are transitive. That is, if must-link(x, y) and must-link(y, z), then must-link(x, z). Cannot-link constraints. Cannot-link constraints are the opposite of must-link constraints. If a cannot-link constraint is specified on two objects, x and y, then in the output of the cluster analysis, x and y should belong to different clusters. Cannot-link constraints can be entailed. That is, if cannot-link(x, y), must-link(x, x ), and must-link(y, y ), then cannot-link(x , y ). A constraint on instances can be defined using specific instances. Alternatively, it can also be defined using instance variables or attributes of instances. For example, a constraint, uses the distance between objects to specify a must-link constraint.
