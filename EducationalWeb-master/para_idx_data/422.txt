In our presentation, we have organized attributes into nominal, binary, ordinal, and numeric types. There are many ways to organize attribute types. The types are not mutually exclusive. Classification algorithms developed from the field of machine learning often talk of attributes as being either discrete or continuous. Each type may be processed differently. A discrete attribute has a finite or countably infinite set of values, which may or may not be represented as integers. The attributes hair color, smoker, medical test, and drink size each have a finite number of values, and so are discrete. Note that discrete attributes may have numeric values, such as 0 and 1 for binary attributes or, the values 0 to 110 for the attribute age. An attribute is countably infinite if the set of possible values is infinite but the values can be put in a one-to-one correspondence with natural numbers. For example, the attribute customer ID is countably infinite. The number of customers can grow to infinity, but in reality, the actual set of values is countable (where the values can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the set of integers). Zip codes are another example. If an attribute is not discrete, it is continuous. The terms numeric attribute and continuous attribute are often used interchangeably in the literature. (This can be confusing because, in the classic sense, continuous values are real numbers, whereas numeric values can be either integers or real numbers.) In practice, real values are represented using a finite number of digits. Continuous attributes are typically represented as floating-point variables.
