By now you have learned what clustering is and know several popular clustering methods. You may ask, "When I try out a clustering method on a data set, how can I evaluate whether the clustering results are good?" In general, cluster evaluation assesses the feasibility of clustering analysis on a data set and the quality of the results generated by a clustering method. The major tasks of clustering evaluation include the following: Assessing clustering tendency. In this task, for a given data set, we assess whether a nonrandom structure exists in the data. Blindly applying a clustering method on a data set will return clusters; however, the clusters mined may be misleading. Clustering analysis on a data set is meaningful only when there is a nonrandom structure in the data. Determining the number of clusters in a data set. A few algorithms, such as k-means, require the number of clusters in a data set as the parameter. Moreover, the number of clusters can be regarded as an interesting and important summary statistic of a data set. Therefore, it is desirable to estimate this number even before a clustering algorithm is used to derive detailed clusters. Measuring clustering quality. After applying a clustering method on a data set, we want to assess how good the resulting clusters are. A number of measures can be used. Some methods measure how well the clusters fit the data set, while others measure how well the clusters match the ground truth, if such truth is available. There are also measures that score clusterings and thus can compare two sets of clustering results on the same data set. In the rest of this section, we discuss each of these three topics.
