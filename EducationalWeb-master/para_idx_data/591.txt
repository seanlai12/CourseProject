A heterogeneous network contains interconnected nodes and links of different types. Such interconnected structures contain rich information, which can be used to mutually enhance nodes and links, and propagate knowledge from one type to another. Clustering and ranking of such heterogeneous networks can be performed hand-inhand in the context that highly ranked nodes/links in a cluster may contribute more than their lower-ranked counterparts in the evaluation of the cohesiveness of a cluster. Clustering may help consolidate the high ranking of objects/links dedicated to the cluster. Such mutual enhancement of ranking and clustering prompted the development of an algorithm called RankClus. Moreover, users may specify different ranking rules or present labeled nodes/links for certain data types. Knowledge of one type can be propagated to other types. Such propagation reaches the nodes/links of the same type via heterogeneous-type connections. Algorithms have been developed for supervised learning and semi-supervised learning in heterogeneous networks.
