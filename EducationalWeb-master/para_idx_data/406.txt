The categorical distribution is to the multinomial distribution as the Bernoulli is to the binomial. The multinomial is the probability of observing each word k i occur x i times in a total of n trials. If we're given a document vector of counts, we can use the multinomial to find the probability of observing documents with those counts of words (regardless of position). The probability density function is given as follows: We can also write its pdf as It should be straightforward to relate the more general multinomial distribution to its binomial counterpart.
