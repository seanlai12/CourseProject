We discussed one potential drawback to PMI and nPMI. Is there any sort of preprocessing you can do that helps with this issue? For example, can we set a threshold on the type of words in the window, the minimum or maximum frequency of each word, or the implementation of the window itself? 14.11. What type of index structure could we use to efficiently store word vectors? Assume that the distribution of values is sparse in each vector. 14.12. Design a way to cluster documents based on multiple feature types. As a first case, consider clustering on both unigram words and unigram POS tags. As a more advanced case, consider clustering documents via unigram words, sentence lengths, and structural parse tree features. Hint: how would we do this in META?
