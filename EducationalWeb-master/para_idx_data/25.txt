Machine learning is a very important technique for solving many problems, and has very broad applications. In text data management and analysis, it has also many uses. Any in-depth treatment of this topic would clearly be beyond the scope of this book, but here we introduce some basic concepts in machine learning that are needed to better understand the content later in the book. Machine learning techniques can often be classified into two types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, a computer would learn how to compute a function≈∑ = f (x) based on a set of examples of the input value x (called training data) and the corresponding expected output value y. It is called "supervised" because typically the y values must be provided by humans for each x, and thus the computer receives a form of supervision from the humans. Once the function is learned, the computer would be able to take unseen values of x and compute the function f (x). When y takes a value from a finite set of values, which can be called labels, a function f ( . ) can serve as a classifier in that it can be used to map an instance x to the "right" label (or multiple correct labels when appropriate). Thus, the problem can be called a classification problem. The simplest case of the classification problem is when we have just two labels (known as binary classification). When y
