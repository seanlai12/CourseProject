In addition to sequences and graphs, there are many other kinds of semi-structured or unstructured data, such as spatiotemporal, multimedia, and hypertext data, which have interesting applications. Such data carry various kinds of semantics, are either stored in or dynamically streamed through a system, and call for specialized data mining methodologies. Thus, mining multiple kinds of data, including spatial data, spatiotemporal data, cyber-physical system data, multimedia data, text data, web data, and data streams, are increasingly important tasks in data mining. In this subsection, we overview the methodologies for mining these kinds of data.
