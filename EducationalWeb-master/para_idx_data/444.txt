The dissimilarity between two objects i and j can be computed based on the ratio of mismatches: where m is the number of matches (i.e., the number of attributes for which i and j are in the same state), and p is the total number of attributes describing the objects. Weights can be assigned to increase the effect of m or to assign greater weight to the matches in attributes having a larger number of states.  Since here we have one nominal attribute, test-1, we set p = 1 in Eq. (2.11) so that d(i, j) evaluates to 0 if objects i and j match, and 1 if the objects differ. Thus, we get From this, we see that all objects are dissimilar except objects 1 and 4 (i.e., d(4, 1) = 0). Alternatively, similarity can be computed as (2.12) Proximity between objects described by nominal attributes can be computed using an alternative encoding scheme. Nominal attributes can be encoded using asymmetric binary attributes by creating a new binary attribute for each of the M states. For an object with a given state value, the binary attribute representing that state is set to 1, while the remaining binary attributes are set to 0. For example, to encode the nominal attribute map color, a binary attribute can be created for each of the five colors previously listed. For an object having the color yellow, the yellow attribute is set to 1, while the remaining four attributes are set to 0. Proximity measures for this form of encoding can be calculated using the methods discussed in the next subsection.
