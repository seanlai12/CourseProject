the similarity between these words based on their context similarity. This provides yet another way to do term weighting for paradigmatic relation discovery. To summarize this chapter about word association mining, we introduced two basic associations called paradigmatic and a syntagmatic relations. These are fairly general since they apply to any items in any language; that is, the units don't have to be words (they can be phrases or entities). We introduced multiple statistical approaches for discovering them, mainly showing that pure statistical approaches are viable for discovering both kinds of relations. And they can be combined to perform joint analysis as well. These approaches can be applied to any text with no human effort, mostly because they are based on simple word counting, yet they can actually discover interesting word relations. We can also use different ways to define context and segment, and this would lead us to some interesting variations of applications. For example, the context can be very narrow like a few words, around a word, a sentence, or maybe paragraphs. Using differing contexts would allow discovery of different flavors of paradigmatic relations. Of course, these associations can support many other applications in both information retrieval and text data mining. Discovery of word associations is closely related to term clustering, a topic that will be discussed in detail in Chapter 14, where some advanced techniques that can be potentially used for word association discovery will also be briefly discussed.
