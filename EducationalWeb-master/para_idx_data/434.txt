How can we convey data to users effectively? Data visualization aims to communicate data clearly and effectively through graphical representation. Data visualization has been used extensively in many applications-for example, at work for reporting, managing business operations, and tracking progress of tasks. More popularly, we can take advantage of visualization techniques to discover data relationships that are otherwise not easily observable by looking at the raw data. Nowadays, people also use data visualization to create fun and interesting graphics. In this section, we briefly introduce the basic concepts of data visualization. We start with multidimensional data such as those stored in relational databases. We discuss several representative approaches, including pixel-oriented techniques, geometric projection techniques, icon-based techniques, and hierarchical and graph-based techniques. We then discuss the visualization of complex data and relations.
