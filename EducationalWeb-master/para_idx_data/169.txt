for NDCG in order to normalize our own DCG in the range [0, 1]. Essentially, we compare the actual DCG with the best result you can possibly get for this query. This doesn't affect the relative comparison of systems for just one topic because this ideal DCG is the same for all the systems. The difference is when we have multiple topics-if we don't do normalization, different topics will have different scales of DCG. For a query like this one, we have nine highly relevant documents, but of course that will not always be the case. Thus, NDCG is used for measuring relevance based on much more than one relevance level. In a more general way, this is basically a measure that can be applied through any ranked task with a large range of judgments. Furthermore, the scale of the judgments can be dependant on the application at hand. The main idea of this measure is to summarize the total utility of the top k documents; you always choose a cutoff, and then you measure the total utility. It discounts the contribution from lowly ranked documents, and finally, it performs normalization to ensure comparability across queries.
