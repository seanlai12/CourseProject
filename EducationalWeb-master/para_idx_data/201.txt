Use META's search engine to implement beta-gamma thresholding. Use a dataset with relevance judgements as the user preferences, and a small number of 236 Chapter 11 Recommender Systems related queries as the initial user profile. Shuffle document IDs and examine them sequentially to simulate a data stream. 11.6. We described a linear utility function U for scoring the usefulness of the filtering system's output. Give an example of a nonlinear utility function. How does this compare to the version introduced in this chapter? 11.7. In our description of beta-gamma thresholding, we showed the user a document if score(d) > Î¸. Can you think of an alternate scoring strategy? Your strategy may include additional features about the document or user if they are available. If possible, evaluate your alternate scoring function in META.
