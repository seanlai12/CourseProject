Text categorization has been extensively studied and is covered in Manning et al. [2008]. An early survey of the topic can be found in Sebastiani [2002]; a more recent one can be found in Aggarwal and Zhai [2012] where one chapter is devoted to this topic. Yang [1999] includes a systematic empirical evaluation of multiple commonly used text categorization methods and a discussion of text categorization evaluation. Moreover, since text categorization is often performed by using supervised machine learning, any book on machine learning is relevant (e.g., Mitchell 1997 This makes it very likely to be able to create a hyperplane separating class objects plotted in this high-dimensional space. Based on this information, make a suggestion for a default classifier to use in text categorization and explain your reasoning.
