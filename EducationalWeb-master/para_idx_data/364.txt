In many applications, we may be interested in mining text data to understand events that happened in the real world. As a special case, we may be interested in using text mining to understand a time series. For example, we might have observed a sudden drop in prices on the stock market in a particular time period and would like to see if the companion text data such as news might help explain what happened. If the crashing time of the stocks corresponds to a time when a particular news topic suddenly appeared in the news stream, there might be a potential relationship between the topic and the stock crash. Similarly, one might also be interested in understanding what topics reported in the news stream were relevant for a presidential election, and thus interested in finding topics in news stream that are correlated with the fluctuation of the Presidential Prediction Market (which measures people's opinions toward each presidential candidate). All these cases are special cases of a general problem of joint analysis of text and a time series to discover causal topics. Here we use the term causal in a nonrigorous way to refer to any topic that might be related to the time series and thus can be potentially causal. This analysis task is illustrated in Figure 19.14. The input includes a time series plus text data that are produced in the same time period, also known as a companion text stream. The time series can be regarded as a • Input: -Time series -Text data produced in a similar time period (text stream) • Output: -Topics whose coverage in the text stream has strong correlations with the time series ("causal" topics) Time Tax cut Gun control … … Figure 19.14 The task of causal topic mining.
