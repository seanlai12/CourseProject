In this chapter, we discussed the general problem of analyzing both structured data and unstructured text data in a joint manner, which is needed for predictive modeling based on big data. We specifically focused on the discussion of text-based prediction, which is generally very useful for big data applications that involve text data. Since text-based prediction can help us infer new knowledge about the world, some of which can even go beyond what's discussed in the content of text, textbased prediction is often very useful for optimizing our decision making, especially when combined with other non-text data that are often also available, and it has widespread applications. Non-text data can provide a context for mining text data, while text data can also help interpret patterns discovered from non-text data (such as pattern annotation). The joint analysis of text and non-text data is a relatively new active research frontier. In this chapter, we covered a number of general techniques that combine topic analysis with non-text data, including contextual probabilistic latent semantic analysis (CPLSA) that embeds context variables such as time and location directly in a topic model, network-supervised topic modeling that uses companion network/graph structure of text data to regularize topic discovery, and time series as context for discovering potentially causal topics from text data. Due to space limitations, we only provided a brief introduction to the high-level ideas of these approaches without elaboration, but we have included sample results of all of them to help understand the potential applications that they can enable. These approaches are all general, and thus they can be potentially applied to many different domains.
