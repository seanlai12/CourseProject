HÃ¶ppner Klawonn, Kruse, and Runkler [HKKR99] provide a thorough discussion of fuzzy clustering. The fuzzy c-means algorithm (on which Example 11.7 is based) was proposed by Bezdek Dempster, Laird, and Rubin [DLR77] are recognized as the first to introduce the EM algorithm and give it its name. However, the idea of the EM algorithm had been "proposed many times in special circumstances" before, as admitted in Dempster, Laird, and Rubin [DLR77]. Wu [Wu83] gives the correct analysis of the EM algorithm. Mixture models and EM algorithms are used extensively in many data mining applications. Introductions to model-based clustering, mixture models, and EM algorithms can be found in recent textbooks on machine learning and statistical learning-for example, Bishop  presented a framework for constraint-based clustering based on user-specified constraints. An efficient method for constraint-based spatial clustering in the existence of physical obstacle constraints was proposed by Tung, Hou, and Han [THH01].
