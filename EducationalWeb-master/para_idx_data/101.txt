In the query likelihood retrieval model, we quantify how likely a user would pose a particular query in order to find a particular document. Figure 6.20 shows how the query likelihood model assumes a user imagines some ideal document and generates a query based on that ideal document's content. In this example, the ideal document is about "presidential campaign news." Under this model, the user would use this ideal document as a basis to compose a query to try and retrieve a desired document. More concretely, we assume that the query is generated by sampling words from the document. For example, a user might pick a word like presidential from this imaginary document, and then use this as a query word. The user would then pick another word like campaign, and that would be the second query word. Of course, this is only an assumption we have made about how users pose queries. Whether a user actually follows this process is a different question. Importantly, though, this assumption has allowed us to formally characterize the conditional probability of a query given a document without relying on the big table that was presented earlier. This is why we can use this fundamental idea to further derive retrieval functions that we can implement with language models.
