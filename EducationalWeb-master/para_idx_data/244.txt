Algorithm 14.1 K-means clustering algorithm Initialize K randomly selected centroids while not converged do Assign each document to the cluster whose centroid is closest to it using sim( . ) (Ex.) Recompute centroids of the new clusters found from previous step (Max.) end while Average-link is a compromise between the two previous measures. As its name implies, it takes the smallest average distance between two clusters. Both single-link and complete-link are sensitive to outliers since they rely on only the similarity of one pair of documents. Average-link is essentially a group decision, making it less sensitive to outliers. Of course, as with most methods discussed in this book, the specific application will determine which method is preferred. In fact, it may even be useful to try out different document-document similarity measures combined with different cluster-cluster similarity measures to see how the dataset is partitioned.
