Before we introduce specific models, we first take a look at the common form of a state-of-the-art retrieval model and examine some of the common ideas used in all these models. This is illustrated in Figure 6.1. First, these models are all based on the assumption of using a bag-of-words representation of text. This was explained in detail in the natural language processing chapter. A bag-of-words representation remains the main representation used in all the search engines. With this assumption, the score of a query like presidential campaign news, with respect to a document d, would be based on scores computed on each individual query word. That means the score would depend on the score of each word, such as presidential, campaign, and news.
