A researcher wishes to show that his method is better than an existing method. He used a statistical significance test and found that with 95% confidence, the results were random (i.e., his method was not arguably better). If he changes the confidence level to 90%, he can show that his method is better than the baseline using the same significance test. Is there anything wrong with this? 9.8. How does stemming words affect retrieval performance? Design an experiment to find an answer. What is your dataset? What other information do you need in order to perform this test? How can you quantify the results? 9.9. Use META to perform the stemming experiment described above. A corpus with relevance judgements can be found on the META site. 9.10. Find the best unigram words tokenization method for retrieval. For example, consider lowercasing, keeping only alpha characters, stemming, stopword removal, or a combination of these. Quantify your results by using IR evaluation techniques. 9.11. Find a publicly available dataset and create your own queries and relevance judgements for it using the META format (described on the site).
