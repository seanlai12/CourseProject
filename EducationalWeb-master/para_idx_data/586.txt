Graphs represents a more general class of structures than sets, sequences, lattices, and trees. There is a broad range of graph applications on the Web and in social networks, information networks, biological networks, bioinformatics, chemical informatics, computer vision, and multimedia and text retrieval. Hence, graph and network mining have become increasingly important and heavily researched. We overview the following major themes: (1) graph pattern mining; (2) statistical modeling of networks; (3) data cleaning, integration, and validation by network analysis; (4) clustering and classification of graphs and homogeneous networks; (5) clustering, ranking, and classification of heterogeneous networks; (6) role discovery and link prediction in information networks; (7) similarity search and OLAP in information networks; and (8) evolution of information networks.
