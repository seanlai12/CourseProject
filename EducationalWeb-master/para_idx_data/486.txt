Partitioning and hierarchical methods are designed to find spherical-shaped clusters. They have difficulty finding clusters of arbitrary shape such as the "S" shape and oval clusters in Figure 10.13. Given such data, they would likely inaccurately identify convex regions, where noise or outliers are included in the clusters. To find clusters of arbitrary shape, alternatively, we can model clusters as dense regions in the data space, separated by sparse regions. This is the main strategy behind density-based clustering methods, which can discover clusters of nonspherical shape. In this section, you will learn the basic techniques of density-based clustering by studying three representative methods, namely, DBSCAN (Section 10.4.1), OPTICS (Section 10.4.2), and DENCLUE (Section 10.4.3).
