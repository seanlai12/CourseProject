The values of an ordinal attribute have a meaningful order or ranking about them, yet the magnitude between successive values is unknown (Section 2.1.4). An example includes the sequence small, medium, large for a size attribute. Ordinal attributes may also be obtained from the discretization of numeric attributes by splitting the value range into a finite number of categories. These categories are organized into ranks. That is, the range of a numeric attribute can be mapped to an ordinal attribute f having M f states. For example, the range of the interval-scaled attribute temperature (in Celsius) can be organized into the following states: −30 to −10, −10 to 10, 10 to 30, representing the categories cold temperature, moderate temperature, and warm temperature, respectively. Let M represent the number of possible states that an ordinal attribute can have. These ordered states define the ranking 1, . . . , M f . "How are ordinal attributes handled?" The treatment of ordinal attributes is quite similar to that of numeric attributes when computing dissimilarity between objects. Suppose that f is an attribute from a set of ordinal attributes describing n objects. The dissimilarity computation with respect to f involves the following steps: 1. The value of f for the ith object is x if , and f has M f ordered states, representing the ranking 1, . . . , M f . Replace each x if by its corresponding rank, r if ∈ {1, . . . , M f }.
