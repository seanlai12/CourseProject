Multimedia data mining is the discovery of interesting patterns from multimedia databases that store and manage large collections of multimedia objects, including image data, video data, audio data, as well as sequence data and hypertext data containing text, text markups, and linkages. Multimedia data mining is an interdisciplinary field that integrates image processing and understanding, computer vision, data mining, and pattern recognition. Issues in multimedia data mining include content-based retrieval and similarity search, and generalization and multidimensional analysis. Multimedia data cubes contain additional dimensions and measures for multimedia information. Other topics in multimedia mining include classification and prediction analysis, mining associations, and video and audio data mining (Section 13.2.3).
