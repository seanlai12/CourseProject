Research on the theoretical foundations of data mining has yet to mature. A solid and systematic theoretical foundation is important because it can help provide a coherent 13.2 Other Methodologies of Data Mining 601 framework for the development, evaluation, and practice of data mining technology. Several theories for the basis of data mining include the following: Data reduction: In this theory, the basis of data mining is to reduce the data representation. Data reduction trades accuracy for speed in response to the need to obtain quick approximate answers to queries on very large databases. Data reduction techniques include singular value decomposition (the driving element behind principal components analysis), wavelets, regression, log-linear models, histograms, clustering, sampling, and the construction of index trees. Data compression: According to this theory, the basis of data mining is to compress the given data by encoding in terms of bits, association rules, decision trees, clusters, and so on. Encoding based on the minimum description length principle states that the "best" theory to infer from a data set is the one that minimizes the length of the theory and of the data when encoded, using the theory as a predictor for the data. This encoding is typically in bits. Probability and statistical theory: According to this theory, the basis of data mining is to discover joint probability distributions of random variables, for example, Bayesian belief networks or hierarchical Bayesian models.
