connect all the related data together as a big network, and associate text data with various structures in the network. For example, text data can be associated with the nodes of the network; such a case can be analyzed by using NetPLSA as we have just discussed. However, text data can also be associated with edges in a network, paths, or even subnetworks to help discover topics or perform comparative analysis.
