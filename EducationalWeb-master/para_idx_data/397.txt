META has an implementation of the LDA topic modeling algorithm, which contains symmetric priors for the word and topic distributions. Modify META to contain non-uniform priors on the topic-word distributions to encode some additional knowledge into the prior. For example, in the sentiment analysis task, create two prior distributions that have high weights on particular "good" and "bad" topic distributions. That is, the prior for the "good" topic should probably weight the Exercises 411 term excellent relatively high and the "bad" topic should weight the term broken relatively high.
