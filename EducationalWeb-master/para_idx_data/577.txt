Regression analysis of time-series data has been studied substantially in the fields of statistics and signal analysis. However, one may often need to go beyond pure regression analysis and perform trend analysis for many practical applications. Trend analysis builds an integrated model using the following four major components or movements to characterize time-series data: 1. Trend or long-term movements: These indicate the general direction in which a time-series graph is moving over time, for example, using weighted moving average and the least squares methods to find trend curves such as the dashed curve indicated in Figure 13.2.
