Let's think about why we have to do evaluation. There are two main reasons; the first is that we have to use evaluation to figure out which retrieval method works the best. This is very important for advancing our knowledge, otherwise we wouldn't know whether a new idea works better than an old idea. Previously in this book (Chapter 6), we discussed the problem of text retrieval and compared it with database retrieval. Search engine evaluation must rely on users, so this becomes a very challenging problem. Because of this, we must determine how we can get users involved and draw a fair comparison of different methods. The second reason to perform evaluation is to assess the actual utility of an overall TR system (as opposed to specific methods). Imagine you're building your own applications; you would be interested in knowing how well your search engine works for your users. In this case, measures must reflect the utility to the actual users in the real application as opposed to measures on each individual retrieval result. Typically, this has been done via user studies-where human users interact with the corpus via the system. In the case of comparing different methods, the measures we use all need to be correlated with the utility to the users. The measures only need to be good enough to determine which method works better. This is usually done by using a test collection, which is a main idea that we'll be talking about 168 Chapter 9 Search Engine Evaluation in this chapter. This has been very important for comparing different algorithms and for improving search engines systems in general.
