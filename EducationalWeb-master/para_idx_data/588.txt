A network consists of a set of nodes, each corresponding to an object associated with a set of properties, and a set of edges (or links) connecting those nodes, representing relationships between objects. A network is homogeneous if all the nodes and links are of the same type, such as a friend network, a coauthor network, or a web page network. A network is heterogeneous if the nodes and links are of different types, such as publication networks (linking together authors, conferences, papers, and contents), and health-care networks (linking together doctors, nurses, patients, diseases, and treatments). Researchers have proposed multiple statistical models for modeling homogeneous networks. The most well-known generative models are the random graph model (i.e., the Erdös-Rényi model), the Watts-Strogatz model, and the scale-free model. The scalefree model assumes that the network follows the power law distribution (also known as the Pareto distribution or the heavy-tailed distribution). In most large-scale social networks, a small-world phenomenon is observed, that is, the network can be characterized as having a high degree of local clustering for a small fraction of the nodes (i.e., these nodes are interconnected with one another), while being no more than a few degrees of separation from the remaining nodes. Social networks exhibit certain evolutionary characteristics. They tend to follow the densification power law, which states that networks become increasingly dense over time. Shrinking diameter is another characteristic, where the effective diameter often decreases as the network grows. Node out-degrees and in-degrees typically follow a heavytailed distribution.
