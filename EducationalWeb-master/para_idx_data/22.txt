in the corpus could be the value of p(w i | θ). This can be shown to be the solution of the MLE of the model. More sophisticated models and their parameter estimation will be discussed later in the book. Finally, once we have θ defined, what can we actually do with it? One use case would be analyzing the probability of a specific subset of words in the corpus, and another could be observing unseen data and calculating the probability of seeing the words in the new text. It is often possible to design the model such that the model parameters would encode the knowledge we hope to discover from text data. In such a case, the estimated model parameters can be directly used as the output (result) of text mining. Please keep in mind that probabilistic models are a general tool and don't only have to be used for text analysis-that's just our main application!
