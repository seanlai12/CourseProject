a pairwise score between two words w 1 and w 2 . If these scores are normalized, we can still cluster the entire set of terms by using the pairwise scores. As in all clustering problems, definition of similarity is important. In the case of term clustering, the question is how we should define the similarity between two terms. It is easy to see that the paradigmatic relations and syntagmatic relations between words (or terms) are both natural candidates for serving as a basis to define similarity. The paradigmatic relation similarity would lead to clusters of terms that tend to occur in very similar contexts with the same relative "location" in the context, whereas the syntagmatic relations would lead to clusters of terms that are semantically related and also tend to co-occur in similar contexts but in different "locations." In the rest, we will first revisit a method for finding semantically related words from earlier in this book. Then, we introduce the concept of pointwise mutual information and show how it can also be used to find related terms. We end with an introduction to more advanced term clustering methods.
