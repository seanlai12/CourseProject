Given a biological sequence, biologists would like to analyze what that sequence represents. To represent the structure or statistical regularities of sequence classes, biologists construct various probabilistic models such as Markov chains and hidden Markov models. In both models, the probability of a state depends only on that of the previous state; therefore, they are particularly useful for the analysis of biological sequence data. The most common methods for constructing hidden Markov models are the forward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, and the Baum-Welch algorithm. Given a sequence of symbols, x, the forward algorithm finds the probability of obtaining x in the model; the Viterbi algorithm finds the most probable path (corresponding to x) through the model, whereas the Baum-Welch algorithm learns or adjusts the model parameters so as to best explain a set of training sequences.
