META's goal is to improve upon and complement the current body of open source machine learning and information retrieval software. The existing environment of this open source software tends to be quite fragmented. There is rarely a single location for a wide variety of algorithms; a good example of this is the LIBLINEAR [Fan et al. 2008] software package for SVMs. While this is the most cited of the open source implementations of linear SVMs, it focuses solely on kernel-less methods. If presented with a nonlinear classification problem, one would be forced to find a different software package that supports kernels (such as the same authors' LIBSVM package [Chang and Lin 2011]). This places an undue burden on the researchers and students-not only are they required to have a detailed understanding of the research problem at hand, but they are now forced to understand this fragmented nature of the open-source software community, find the appropriate tools in this mishmash of implementations, and compile and configure the appropriate tool. Even when this is all done, there is the problem of data formatting-it is unlikely that the tools have standardized upon a single input format, so a certain amount of data preprocessing is now required. This all detracts from the actual task at hand, which has a marked impact on the speed of discovery and education. META addresses these issues. In particular, it provides a unifying framework for text indexing and analysis methods, allowing users to quickly run controlled experiments. It modularizes the feature generation, instance representation, data storage formats, and algorithm implementations; this allows for researchers and students to make seamless transitions along any of these dimensions with minimal effort.
