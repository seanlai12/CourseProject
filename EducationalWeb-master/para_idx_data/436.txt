which consists of four dimensions: income, credit limit, transaction volume, and age. Can we analyze the correlation between income and the other attributes by visualization? We can sort all customers in income-ascending order, and use this order to lay out the customer data in the four visualization windows, as shown in Figure 2.10. The pixel colors are chosen so that the smaller the value, the lighter the shading. Using pixelbased visualization, we can easily observe the following: credit limit increases as income increases; customers whose income is in the middle range are more likely to purchase more from AllElectronics; there is no clear correlation between income and age. In pixel-oriented techniques, data records can also be ordered in a query-dependent way. For example, given a point query, we can sort all records in descending order of similarity to the point query. Filling a window by laying out the data records in a linear way may not work well for a wide window. The first pixel in a row is far away from the last pixel in the previous row, though they are next to each other in the global order. Moreover, a pixel is next to the one above it in the window, even though the two are not next to each other in the global order. To solve this problem, we can lay out the data records in a space-filling curve to fill the windows. A space-filling curve is a curve with a range that covers the entire n-dimensional unit hypercube. Since the visualization windows are 2-D, we can use any 2-D space-filling curve. Figure 2.11 shows some frequently used 2-D space-filling curves. Note that the windows do not have to be rectangular. For example, the circle segment technique uses windows in the shape of segments of a circle, as illustrated in Figure 2.12. This technique can ease the comparison of dimensions because the dimension windows are located side by side and form a circle.
