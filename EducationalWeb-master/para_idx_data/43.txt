There are many textbooks on NLP, including, Speech and Language Processing [Jurafsky and Martin 2009], Foundations of Statistical NLP [Manning and Sch√ºtze 1999], and Natural Language Understanding [Allen 1995]. An in-depth coverage of statistical language models can be found in the book Statistical Methods for Speech Recognition [Jelinek 1997]. Rosenfeld [2000]   review of statistical language models. Zhai [2008] contains a detailed discussion of the use of statistical language models for information retrieval, some of which will be covered in later chapters of this book. An important topic in NLP that we have not covered much in this chapter is information extraction. A comprehensive introduction to this topic can be found in Sarawagi [2008], and a useful survey can be found in Jiang [2012]. For a discussion of this topic in the context of information retrieval, see the book Moens [2006].
