In extractive summarization, representative sentences were selected from passages in the text and output as a summary. This solution is modeled as an information retrieval problem, and we can evaluate it as such. Redundancy is a critical issue, and the MMR technique we discussed attempts to alleviate it. When doing our evaluation, we should consider redundant sentences to be irrelevant, since the user does not want to read the same information twice. For a more detailed explanation of IR evaluation measures, please consult Chapter 9. For full output scoring, we should prefer IR evaluation metrics that do not take into account result position. Although our summary is generated by ranked sentences per passage, the entire output is not a ranked list since the original document is composed of multiple passages. Therefore we can use precision, recall, and F 1 score.
