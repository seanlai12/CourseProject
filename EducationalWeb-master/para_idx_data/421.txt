A temperature attribute is interval-scaled. Suppose that we have the outdoor temperature value for a number of different days, where each day is an object. By ordering the values, we obtain a ranking of the objects with respect to temperature. In addition, we can quantify the difference between values. For example, a temperature of 20 • C is five degrees higher than a temperature of 15 • C. Calendar dates are another example. For instance, the years 2002 and 2010 are eight years apart. Temperatures in Celsius and Fahrenheit do not have a true zero-point, that is, neither 0 • C nor 0 • F indicates "no temperature." (On the Celsius scale, for example, the unit of measurement is 1/100 of the difference between the melting temperature and the boiling temperature of water in atmospheric pressure.) Although we can compute the difference between temperature values, we cannot talk of one temperature value as being a multiple of another. Without a true zero, we cannot say, for instance, that 10 • C is twice as warm as 5 • C. That is, we cannot speak of the values in terms of ratios. Similarly, there is no true zero-point for calendar dates. (The year 0 does not correspond to the beginning of time.) This brings us to ratio-scaled attributes, for which a true zero-point exits. Because interval-scaled attributes are numeric, we can compute their mean value, in addition to the median and mode measures of central tendency. coordinates (e.g., when clustering houses), and monetary quantities (e.g., you are 100 times richer with $100 than with $1).
