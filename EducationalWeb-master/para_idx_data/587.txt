Graph pattern mining is the mining of frequent subgraphs (also called (sub)graph patterns) in one or a set of graphs. Methods for mining graph patterns can be categorized into Apriori-based and pattern growth-based approaches. Alternatively, we can mine the set of closed graphs where a graph g is closed if there exists no proper supergraph g that carries the same support count as g. Moreover, there are many variant graph patterns, including approximate frequent graphs, coherent graphs, and dense graphs. User-specified constraints can be pushed deep into the graph pattern mining process to improve mining efficiency. Graph pattern mining has many interesting applications. For example, it can be used to generate compact and effective graph index structures based on the concept of frequent and discriminative graph patterns. Approximate structure similarity search can be achieved by exploring graph index structures and multiple graph features. Moreover, classification of graphs can also be performed effectively using frequent and discriminative subgraphs as features.
