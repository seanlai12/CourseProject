Using the k leading eigenvectors, project the original data into the new space defined by the k leading eigenvectors, and run a clustering algorithm such as k-means to find k clusters. The Ng-Jordan-Weiss algorithm stacks the k largest eigenvectors in columns to form a matrix X = [x 1 x 2 · · · x k ] ∈ R n×k . The algorithm forms a matrix Y by renormalizing each row in X to have unit length, that is, (11.26) The algorithm then treats each row in Y as a point in the k-dimensional space R k , and runs k-means (or any other algorithm serving the partitioning purpose) to cluster the points into k clusters. In spectral clustering methods, the dimensionality of the new space is set to the desired number of clusters. This setting expects that each new dimension should be able to manifest a cluster. Example 11.15 The Ng-Jordan-Weiss algorithm. Consider the set of points in Figure 11.11. The data set, the affinity matrix, the three largest eigenvectors, and the normalized vectors are shown. Note that with the three new dimensions (formed by the three largest eigenvectors), the clusters are easily detected. Spectral clustering is effective in high-dimensional applications such as image processing. Theoretically, it works well when certain conditions apply. Scalability, however, is a challenge. Computing eigenvectors on a large matrix is costly. Spectral clustering can be combined with other clustering methods, such as biclustering. Additional information on other dimensionality reduction clustering methods, such as kernel PCA, can be found in the bibliographic notes (Section 11.7).
