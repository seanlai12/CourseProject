The goal of term clustering is quite similar to document clustering; we wish to find related terms. By "related," we usually mean words that have a similar semantic meaning. For example, soccer and basketball are related in the sense that they are both sports. Similarly, evaluation and assessment are related since they are synonyms. In this section we will refer to "terms" and "words" interchangeably, though keep in mind we don't necessarily only have to cluster words. We commonly use this example since it is quite straightforward to imagine. The techniques we describe in this section will generally work for any sequence of features, whether they are words or parse tree fragments. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the algorithms we discuss were designed for use on words in most cases. It's also important to note that in some forms of term "clustering," we only receive
