In this section, we examine the basic measures for evaluation of text retrieval systems. We discuss how to design these basic measures and how to quantitatively compare two systems. Although the systems return a ranked list of documents, the evaluation metrics discussed in this section deal with sets of returned documents; that is, the order of the returned results is not taken into account. These measures and their intuition are used to design other more sophisticated methods, but are also quite valuable on their own.
