Here it is easy to see that the MAP estimate would deviate from the MLE with consideration of maximizing the probability of the parameter according to our prior belief encoded as p (Î¸). It is through the use of appropriate prior that we can address the overfitting problem of MLE since our prior can strongly prefer an estimate where neither heads, nor tails should have a zero probability.
