All future sections in this book will assume the reader has META downloaded and installed. Here, we'll show how to set up META. META has both a website with tutorials and an online repository on GitHub. To actually download the toolkit, users will check it out with the version control software git in their command line terminal after installing any necessary prerequisites. The META website contains instructions for downloading and setting up the software for a particular system configuration. At the time of writing this book, both Linux and Mac OS are supported. Visit https://meta-toolkit.org/setup-guide.html and follow the instructions for the desired platform. We will assume the reader has performed the steps listed in the setup guide and has a working version of META for all exercises and demonstrations in this book. There are two steps that are not mentioned in the setup guide. The first is to make sure the reader has the version of META that was current when this book was published. To ensure that the commands and examples sync up with the software the reader has downloaded, we will ensure that META is checked out with version 2.2.0. Run the following command inside the meta/ directory: The second step is to make sure that any necessary model files are also downloaded. These are available on the META releases page: https://github.com/metatoolkit/meta/releases/tag/v2.2.0. By default, the model files should be placed in the meta/build/ directory, but you can place them anywhere as long as the paths in the config file are updated.
