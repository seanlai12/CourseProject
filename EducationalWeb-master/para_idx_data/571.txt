Compare the SCAN algorithm (Section 11.3.3) with DBSCAN (Section 10.4.1). What are their similarities and differences? 11.8 Consider partitioning clustering and the following constraint on clusters: The number of objects in each cluster must be between n k (1 − δ) and n k (1 + δ), where n is the total number of objects in the data set, k is the number of clusters desired, and δ in [0, 1) is a parameter. Can you extend the k-means method to handle this constraint? Discuss situations where the constraint is hard and soft.
