There are strong syntagmatic relations between words that have correlated cooccurrences. That means when we see one word occur in some context, we tend to see the other word. Consider a more specific example shown in Figure 13.7. We can ask the question, whenever eats occurs, what other words also tend to occur? Looking at the sentences on the left, we see some words that might occur together with eats, like cat, dog, or fish. If we remove them and look at where we only show eats surrounded by two blanks, can we predict what words occur to the left or to the right? If these words are associated with eats, they tend to occur in the context of eats. More specifically, our prediction problem is to take any text segment (which can be a sentence, paragraph, or document) and determine what words are most likely to co-occur in a specific context. Let's consider a particular word w. Is w present or absent in the segment from Figure 13.8? Some words are actually easier to predict than other words-if you
