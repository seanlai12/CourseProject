In the cluster analysis discussed so far, we cluster objects according to their attribute values. Objects and attributes are not treated in the same way. However, in some applications, objects and attributes are defined in a symmetric way, where data analysis involves searching data matrices for submatrices that show unique patterns as clusters. This kind of clustering technique belongs to the category of biclustering. This section first introduces two motivating application examples of biclusteringgene expression and recommender systems. You will then learn about the different types of biclusters. Last, we present biclustering methods.
