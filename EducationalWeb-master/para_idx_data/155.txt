How useful is the system for real user tasks? Here, interfaces and many other things are also important and we typically have to do user studies. In this book, we're going to talk mainly about the effectiveness and accuracy measures because the efficiency and usability dimensions are not unique to search engines (they are needed for evaluating other software systems). There is also very good coverage of such material in other books, so we suggest the reader consult Harman [2011] for further reading in this area. Additional readings are Sanderson [2010] and Kelly [2009], which cover user studies and A-B testing (concepts that are discussed later in this chapter).
