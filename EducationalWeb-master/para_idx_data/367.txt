Top three words in significant topics from New York Times tax cut 1 screen pataki guiliani enthusiasm door symbolic oil energy prices news w top pres al vice love tucker presented partial abortion privatization court supreme abortion gun control nra (Adapted from Kim et al. [2013]) In Figure 19.18, we see some additional results from analyzing presidential election time series. The time series data used here is from the Iowa Electronic market, and the text data is the New York Times data from May-October 2000 that matched at least one candidate's name (i.e., either Bush or Gore). The goal here was to see if we can use causal topic mining to help understand what issues mattered in the 2000 presidential campaign and election. The results shown here are the top three words from the most significant (causal) topics from New York Times. Intuitively, they are indeed quite related to the campaign. The high relevance of topics discovered is at least partly due to the use of the presidential candidate names as an additional context (i.e., as filters), which helped eliminate a lot of nonrelevant text data. However, what is interesting is that the list does contain a few topics that are known to be important in that presidential election, including tax cut, oil energy, abortion, and gun control (see Kim et al. [2013] for a more detailed discussion of the results).
