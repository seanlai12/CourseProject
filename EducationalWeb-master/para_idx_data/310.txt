the coverage of the topic travel, we would have a non-zero count, higher than the estimated coverage of sports. This obviously is also not desirable. Our analysis of this simple example thus reveals a few problems of this approach. First, when we count what words belong to a topic, we also need to consider related words. We cannot simply just count the extracted term denoting a topic (e.g., sports), which may not occur at all in a document about the topic. On the other hand, there are many words related to the topic like basketball and game, which should presumably also be counted when estimating the coverage of a topic. The second problem is that a word like star is ambiguous. While in this article it means a basketball star, it might also mean a star on the sky in another context, so we need to consider the uncertainty of an ambiguous word. Finally, a main restriction of this approach is that we have only one term to describe the topic, so it cannot really describe complicated topics. For example, a very specialized topic in sports would be harder to describe by using just a word or one phrase. We need to use more words. A key take-away point from analyzing this simple example is that there are three general problems with our simple approach of defining a topic as a single term: first, it lacks expressive power. It can only represent the simple general topics, but cannot represent the complicated topics that might require more words to describe. Second, it's incomplete in vocabulary coverage, meaning that the topic itself is only represented as one term. It does not suggest what other terms are related to the topic, making it impossible to estimate the contribution of related words to the coverage of a topic. Finally, there is a problem due to ambiguity of words. A topical term or related term can be ambiguous. In the next section, we will discuss an improved representation of a topic (as a distribution over words) that can address these problems.
