Text data access is the foundation for text analysis. Text access technology plays two important roles in text management and analysis applications. First, it enables retrieval of the most relevant text data to a particular analysis problem, thus avoiding unnecessary overhead from processing a large amount of non-relevant data. Second, it enables interpretation of any analysis results or discovered knowledge in appropriate context and provides data provenance (origin). The general goal of text data access is to connect users with the right information at the right time. This connection can be done in two ways: pull, where the users take the initiative to fetch relevant information out from the system, and push, where the system takes the initiative to offer relevant information to users. In this chapter, we will give a high-level overview of these two modes of text data access. Then, we will formalize and motivate the problem of text retrieval. In the following chapters, we will cover specific techniques for supporting text access in both push and pull modes.
