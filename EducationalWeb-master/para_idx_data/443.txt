A nominal attribute can take on two or more states (Section 2.1.2). For example, map color is a nominal attribute that may have, say, five states: red, yellow, green, pink, and blue. Let the number of states of a nominal attribute be M. The states can be denoted by letters, symbols, or a set of integers, such as 1, 2, . . . , M. Notice that such integers are used just for data handling and do not represent any specific ordering.
