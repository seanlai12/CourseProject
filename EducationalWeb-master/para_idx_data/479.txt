Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies (BIRCH) is designed for clustering a large amount of numeric data by integrating hierarchical clustering (at the initial microclustering stage) and other clustering methods such as iterative partitioning (at the later macroclustering stage). It overcomes the two difficulties in agglomerative clustering methods: (1) scalability and (2) the inability to undo what was done in the previous step. BIRCH uses the notions of clustering feature to summarize a cluster, and clustering feature tree (CF-tree) to represent a cluster hierarchy. These structures help the clustering method achieve good speed and scalability in large or even streaming databases, and also make it effective for incremental and dynamic clustering of incoming objects. Consider a cluster of n d-dimensional data objects or points. The clustering feature (CF) of the cluster is a 3-D vector summarizing information about clusters of objects. It is defined as
