A sequence is an ordered list of events. Sequences may be categorized into three groups, based on the characteristics of the events they describe: (1) time-series data, (2) symbolic sequence data, and (3) biological sequences. Let's consider each type. In time-series data, sequence data consist of long sequences of numeric data, recorded at equal time intervals (e.g., per minute, per hour, or per day). Time-series data can be generated by many natural and economic processes such as stock markets, and scientific, medical, or natural observations. Symbolic sequence data consist of long sequences of event or nominal data, which typically are not observed at equal time intervals. For many such sequences, gaps (i.e., lapses between recorded events) do not matter much. Examples include customer shopping sequences and web click streams, as well as sequences of events in science and engineering and in natural and social developments. Biological sequences include DNA and protein sequences. Such sequences are typically very long, and carry important, complicated, but hidden semantic meaning. Here, gaps are usually important. Let's look into data mining for each of these sequence data types.
