The right side of this equation is easily seen to be a function with p(w | θ F ) as variables. To findθ F , we can, in principle, use any optimization methods. Since the function involves a logarithm of a sum of two terms, it is difficult to obtain a simple analytical solution via the Lagrange Multiplier approach, so in general, we must rely on numerical algorithms. There are many possibilities; EM happens to be just one of them which is quite natural and guaranteed to converge to a local maxima, which, in our case, is also a global maximum, since the likelihood function can be shown to have one unique maximum.
