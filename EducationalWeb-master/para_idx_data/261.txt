Clustering is a general technique in data mining and is usually covered in detail in any book on data mining [Han 2005], [Aggarwal 2015]. There is also a chapter on text clustering in Aggarwal and Zhai [2012], where many text clustering methods are reviewed. An empirical comparison of some document clustering techniques can be found in Steinbach et al. [2000]. Term clustering is related to word association discovery, a topic covered in Chapter 13. An interesting theoretical work on clustering is Kleinberg [2002], where it is shown that there does not exist any clustering that can satisfy a small number of desirable properties (i.e., an impossibility theorem about clustering).
