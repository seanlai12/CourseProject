Opinion mining and sentiment analysis have been extensively studied. Two excellent books on this general topic are the book Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis [Pang and Lee 2008] and the book Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining [Liu 2012]. Multiple extensions of topic models for analyzing opinionated topics have been made (e.g., topic-sentiment mixture model [Mei et al. 2007a], multi-grain topic model [Titov and McDonald 2008], and aspect and sentiment unification model [Jo and Oh 2011]). Techniques for Latent Aspect Rating Analysis are mainly covered in two KDD papers [Wang et al. 2010], [Wang et al. 2011]. Exercises 18.1. In this chapter, we mainly discussed how to determine overall sentiment for a text object. Imagine that we already have the sentiment information as part of the object and we are instead interested in identifying the target of the sentiment. Brainstorm some ideas using NLP techniques mentioned in this book.
