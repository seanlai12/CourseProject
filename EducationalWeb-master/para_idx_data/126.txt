An early empirical comparison of various relevance feedback techniques can be found in Salton and Buckley [1990]. Pseudo-relevance feedback has become popular after positive results being observed in TREC experiments (e.g., Buckley 1994, Xu andCroft 1996). A comparison of feedback approaches in language models is available in Lv and Zhai [2009]. The positional relevance model proposed in Lv and Zhai [2010] appears to be one of the most effective methods for estimating a query language model for pseudo feedback. Due to the availability of a large amount of search engine log data, implicit feedback based on users' interaction behavior has become a very important and very effective technique to enable web search engines to improve their accuracy over time as more and more users are using the systems, though the interpretation of user clickthroughs must take position bias into consideration, which is discussed in detail in Joachims et al. [2007]. A bibliography on implicit feedback can be found in Kelly and Teevan [2003]. In the web search era, implicit feedback is often implemented in the form of using feedback features in a ranking function using machine learning, i.e., learning to rank techniques; they are discussed briefly in Chapter 10 of the book. For a more thorough discussion of mining query logs, see the tutorial [Silvestri 2010].
