Bayes' rule may be derived using the definition of conditional probability: Therefore, setting the two joint probabilities equal, We can simplify them as The above formula is known as Bayes' rule, named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes . This rule has widespread applications. In this book, you will see heavy use of this formula in the text categorization chapter as well as the topic analysis chapter, among others. We will leave it up to the individual chapters to explain their use of this rule in their implementation. Essentially, though, Bayes' rule can be used to make inference about a hypothesis based on the observed evidence related to the hypothesis.
