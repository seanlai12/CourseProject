A forward index may be created in a very similar way to the inverted index. Instead of mapping terms to documents, a forward index maps documents to a list of terms that occur in them. This type of setup is useful when doing other operations aside from search. For example, clustering or classification would need to access an entire document's content at once. Using an inverted index to do this is not efficient at all, since we'd have to scan the entire postings file to find all the terms that occur in a specific document. Thus, we have the forward index structure that records a term vector for each document ID. In the next section, we'll see how using the inverted term-to-document mapping can greatly decrease query scoring time. There are other efficiency aspects that are relevant to the forward index as well, such as compression and caching.
