Histograms (or frequency histograms) are at least a century old and are widely used. "Histos" means pole or mast, and "gram" means chart, so a histogram is a chart of poles. Plotting histograms is a graphical method for summarizing the distribution of a given attribute, X. If X is nominal, such as automobile model or item type, then a pole or vertical bar is drawn for each known value of X. The height of the bar indicates the frequency (i.e., count) of that X value. The resulting graph is more commonly known as a bar chart. If X is numeric, the term histogram is preferred. The range of values for X is partitioned into disjoint consecutive subranges. The subranges, referred to as buckets or bins, are disjoint subsets of the data distribution for X. The range of a bucket is known as the width. Typically, the buckets are of equal width. For example, a price attribute with a value range of $1 to $200 (rounded up to the nearest dollar) can be partitioned into subranges 1 to 20, 21 to 40, 41 to 60, and so on. For each subrange, a bar is drawn with a height that represents the total count of items observed within the subrange. Histograms and partitioning rules are further discussed in Chapter 3 on data reduction. Example 2.15 Histogram. Figure 2.6 shows a histogram for the data set of Table 2.1, where buckets (or bins) are defined by equal-width ranges representing $20 increments and the frequency is the count of items sold. Although histograms are widely used, they may not be as effective as the quantile plot, q-q plot, and boxplot methods in comparing groups of univariate observations.
