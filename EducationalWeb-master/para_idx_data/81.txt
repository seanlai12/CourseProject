One assumption of the probability ranking principle is that each document's usefulness to the user is independent of the usefulness of other documents in the index. What is a scenario where this assumption does not hold? In this chapter, we introduce the two main information retrieval models: vector space and query likelihood, which are among the most effective and practically useful retrieval models. We begin with a brief overview of retrieval models in general and then discuss the two basic models, i.e., the vector space model and the query likelihood model afterward.
