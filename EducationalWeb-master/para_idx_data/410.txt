Suppose that a query q is generated by a generative model p(q | θ Q ) with θ Q denoting the parameters of the query unigram language model. Similarly, assume that a document d is generated by a generative model p(d | θ D ) with θ D denoting the parameters of the document unigram language model. If θ Q and θ D are the estimated query and document language models, respectively, then, the relevance value of d with respect to q can be measured by the following negative KL-divergence function [Zhai and Lafferty 2001]:
