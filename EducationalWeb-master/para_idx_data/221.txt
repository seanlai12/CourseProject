My cat eats fish on Saturday His cat eats turkey on Tuesday My dog eats meat on Sunday His dog eats turkey on Tuesday … What words tend to occur to the left of "eats"? Whenever "eats" occurs, what other words also tend to occur? What words are to the right? My _ eats _ on Saturday His _ eats _ on Tuesday My _ eats _ on Sunday His _ eats _ on Tuesday … Text segment (any unit, e.g., sentence, paragraph, document) Are some words easier to predict than others? (1) w = "meat" (2) w = "the" (3) w = "unicorn" … … Prediction question: Is word w present (or absent) in this segment? take a look at the three words shown in the figure (meat, the, and unicorn), which one do you think is easier to predict? If you think about it for a moment you might conclude that the is easier to predict because it tends to occur everywhere. The word unicorn is also relatively easy to predict because unicorn is rare. However, meat is somewhere in between in terms of frequency, making it harder to predict (since it's possible that it occurs in the segment). Recall our discussion of entropy from Chapter 2. Earlier, we talked about using entropy to capture how easy it is to predict the presence or absence of a word. We can create a random variable X w for a particular word w that depicts whether w occurs. Clearly, this is related to the previous question. Here we will further talk about conditional entropy, which is useful for discovering syntagmatic relations.
