visualization of the results generated from various text mining algorithms is generally desirable. This list also serves as an outline of the major topics to be covered later in this book. Specifically, search and filtering are covered first in Part II about text data access, whereas categorization, clustering, topic analysis, and summarization are covered later in Part III about text data analysis. Information extraction is not covered in this book since we want to focus on general approaches that can be readily applied to text data in any natural language, but information extraction often requires language-specific techniques. Visualization is also not covered due to the intended focus on algorithms in this book. However, it must be stressed that both information extraction and visualization are very important topics relevant to text data analysis and management. Readers interested in these techniques can find some useful references in the Bibliographic Notes at the end of this chapter.
