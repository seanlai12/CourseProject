Suppose that drink size corresponds to the size of drinks available at a fast-food restaurant. This nominal attribute has three possible values: small, medium, and large. The values have a meaningful sequence (which corresponds to increasing drink size); however, we cannot tell from the values how much bigger, say, a medium is than a large. Other examples of ordinal attributes include grade (e.g., A+, A, Aâˆ’, B+, and so on) and professional rank. Professional ranks can be enumerated in a sequential order: for example, assistant, associate, and full for professors, and private, private first class, specialist, corporal, and sergeant for army ranks. Ordinal attributes are useful for registering subjective assessments of qualities that cannot be measured objectively; thus ordinal attributes are often used in surveys for ratings. In one survey, participants were asked to rate how satisfied they were as customers. Customer satisfaction had the following ordinal categories: 0: very dissatisfied, 1: somewhat dissatisfied, 2: neutral, 3: satisfied, and 4: very satisfied. Ordinal attributes may also be obtained from the discretization of numeric quantities by splitting the value range into a finite number of ordered categories as described in Chapter 3 on data reduction. The central tendency of an ordinal attribute can be represented by its mode and its median (the middle value in an ordered sequence), but the mean cannot be defined. Note that nominal, binary, and ordinal attributes are qualitative. That is, they describe a feature of an object without giving an actual size or quantity. The values of such qualitative attributes are typically words representing categories. If integers are used, they represent computer codes for the categories, as opposed to measurable quantities (e.g., 0 for small drink size, 1 for medium, and 2 for large). In the following subsection we look at numeric attributes, which provide quantitative measurements of an object.
