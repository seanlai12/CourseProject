For further reading, we suggest that the reader consult Herlocker et al. [2004], Shani and Gunawardana [2011]. Ricci et al. [2010] is a comprehensive resource for learning more about recommender systems in general. More information about the beta-gamma threshold setting algorithm can be found in Zhai et al. [2000]. A description of memory-based collaborative filtering algorithm can be found in Breese et al. [1998], which also provides a comparison of different collaborative filtering algorithms. A more recent comparison of multiple collaborative filtering algorithms can be found in the Cacheda et al. [2011]. Exercises 11.1. When delivering content to a user, it's important to not deliver duplicate information. Describe a strategy that doesn't deliver a document to a user if it is a duplicate. Then, describe a strategy that doesn't deliver a document if it is too similar to a previously delivered document. Ensure that your methods are space efficient. That is, don't store the full text of every document seen! 11.2. A user may be interested in a few diverse information needs; a user may enjoy both romance movies and action movies. Does this pose any problem to a recommendation system? If so, suggest how this issue may be addressed. If not, explain how the existing structure of the filtering system handles this.
