In collaborative filtering, a system makes decisions for an individual user based on judgements of other users (hence it is "collaborative"). The basic idea is to infer individual interests or preferences based solely on similar users. Given a user, collaborative filtering finds a set of similar users. Based on the set of similar users, it predicts the current user's preferences. This method makes some assumptions. .
