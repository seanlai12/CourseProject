Cluster analysis on graph and network data extracts valuable knowledge and information. Such data are increasingly popular in many applications. We discuss applications and challenges of clustering graph and network data in Section 11.3.1. Similarity measures for this form of clustering are given in Section 11.3.2. You will learn about graph clustering methods in Section 11.3.3. In general, the terms graph and network can be used interchangeably. In the rest of this section, we mainly use the term graph.
