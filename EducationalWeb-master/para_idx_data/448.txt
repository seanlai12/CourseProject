Since each ordinal attribute can have a different number of states, it is often necessary to map the range of each attribute onto [0.0, 1.0] so that each attribute has equal weight. We perform such data normalization by replacing the rank r if of the ith object in the f th attribute by (2.21) 3. Dissimilarity can then be computed using any of the distance measures described in Section 2.4.4 for numeric attributes, using z if to represent the f value for the ith object. Example 2.21 Dissimilarity between ordinal attributes. Suppose that we have the sample data shown earlier in Table 2.2, except that this time only the object-identifier and the continuous ordinal attribute, test-2, are available. There are three states for test-2: fair, good, and excellent, that is, M f = 3. For step 1, if we replace each value for test-2 by its rank, the four objects are assigned the ranks 3, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Step 2 normalizes the ranking by mapping rank 1 to 0.0, rank 2 to 0.5, and rank 3 to 1.0. For step 3, we can use, say, the Euclidean distance (Eq. 2.16), which results in the following dissimilarity matrix: Therefore, objects 1 and 2 are the most dissimilar, as are objects 2 and 4 (i.e., d(2, 1) = 1.0 and d(4, 2) = 1.0). This makes intuitive sense since objects 1 and 4 are both excellent. Object 2 is fair, which is at the opposite end of the range of values for test-2. Similarity values for ordinal attributes can be interpreted from dissimilarity as sim(i, j) = 1 âˆ’ d(i, j).
