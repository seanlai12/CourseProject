Since this chapter concludes our coverage of search engines, we briefly talk about some possible future trends of web search and intelligent information retrieval systems in general. To further improve the accuracy of a search engine, it's important to consider special cases of information need. One particular trend is to have more and more specialized and customized search engines, which can be called vertical search engines. These vertical search engines can be expected to be more effective than the current general search engines because they could assume that a particular user belongs to a special group that might have a common information need. Due to this customization, it's also possible to do personalization. The search can be personalized because we have a better understanding of the users. Restricting the domain of the search engine can also have some advantages in handling the documents, because we would have a better understanding of these documents. For example, particular words may not be ambiguous in such a domain, so we can bypass the problem of ambiguity.
