Because of the difference, the two fields have been traditionally studied in different communities with a different application basis. Databases have had widespread applications in virtually every domain with a well-established strong industry. The IR community that studies text retrieval has been an interdisciplinary community involving library and information science and computer science, but had not had a strong industry base until the Web was born in the early 1990s. Since then, the search engine industry has dominated, and as more and more online information is available, the search engine technologies (which include TR and other technical components such as machine learning and natural language processing) will continue to grow. Soon we will find search technologies to have widespread use just like databases. Furthermore, because of the inherent similarity between database search and TR, because both efficiency and effectiveness (accuracy) are important, and because most online data has text fields as well as some kind of structures, the two fields are now moving closer and closer to each other, leading to some common fundamental questions such as: "What should be the right query language?"; "How can we rank items accurately?"; "How do we find answers quickly?"; and "How do we support interactive search?" Perhaps the most important conclusion from this comparison is that the problem of text retrieval is an empirically defined problem. This means that which method works better cannot be answered by pure analytical reasoning or mathematical proofs. Instead, it has to be empirically evaluated by users, making it a significant challenge in evaluating the effectiveness of a search engine. This is also the reason why a significant amount of effort has been spent in research of TR evaluation since it was initially studied in the 1960s. The evaluation methodology of TR remains an important open research topic today; we discuss it in detail in Chapter 9.
