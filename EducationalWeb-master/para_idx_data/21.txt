3. Apply the model. The first step has already been addressed. In our example, we wish to capture the probabilities of individual words occurring in our corpus. In the second step, we need to figure out actually how to set the probabilities for each word. One obvious way would be to calculate the probability of each individual word in the corpus itself. That is, the count of a unique word w i divided by the total number of words
