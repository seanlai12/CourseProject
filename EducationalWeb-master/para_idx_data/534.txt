While subspace search methods search for clusters with a similarity that is measured using conventional metrics like distance or density, correlation-based approaches can further discover clusters that are defined by advanced correlation models. Example 11.11 A correlation-based approach using PCA. As an example, a PCA-based approach first applies PCA (Principal Components Analysis; see Chapter 3) to derive a set of new, uncorrelated dimensions, and then mine clusters in the new space or its subspaces. In addition to PCA, other space transformations may be used, such as the Hough transform or fractal dimensions.
